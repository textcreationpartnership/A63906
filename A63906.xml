            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Obligations for which I ſtand indebted to Your <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> are ſo many and ſo great, and the <hi>Friendſhip</hi> with which you have been pleaſed to own an unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſo conſtant, ſo ſyncere, ſo zealous, that I am forced to break out into this publick <hi>Reſentment,</hi> rather out of <hi>neceſſity</hi> than <hi>deliberation</hi> or <hi>choice,</hi> to eaſe my ſelf of a <hi>Load</hi> of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> which is very troubleſom to me, while it keeps within and preys upon it ſelf, without any hopes of ever being conſumed, like the <hi>Torments</hi> of that <hi>miſerable State</hi> to which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:102592:4"/> as well as the unjuſt, or cruel, or intemperate are condemned, rather than that I have any proſpect of doing any thing by it, which You will interpret a <hi>Service</hi> or a <hi>reſpect,</hi> whoſe <hi>Modesty</hi> is ſuch in the midſt of many excellent <hi>Vertues,</hi> that it endeavours to conceal them even from Your ſelf, and will ſcarce endure to hear of them from others.</p>
            <p>You muſt Pardon me therefore, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provoked to <hi>extremity</hi> by an importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> that purſues me with ſo unuſual an <hi>Affection</hi> through every <hi>Stage,</hi> and every days Journey of my <hi>Life,</hi> I now endeavour to make You, as You ought to be, an <hi>Example</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> that You may not ſhine any longer in <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> though that be no more than the beſt <hi>Diamonds</hi> are known to do, but that like the Sun, the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of the Day, You may communicate the <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> of Your <hi>Temper</hi> to the cold and inſenſible Corners of the Earth, where the Poles of <hi>Humanity</hi> move with a liſtleſs Pace, and where <hi>true Honour</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip</hi> are not known. Not that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to preſent You with a <hi>Character</hi> of Your ſelf: For it may be dangerous to tell You all Your own, as humble and as equal
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:102592:4"/> as You are, as free from any thing of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> or <hi>Affectation:</hi> But inſtead of that as a further <hi>Testimony</hi> to, and a new <hi>Tryal</hi> of, the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Gallantry</hi> of Your mind, I lay this worthleſs <hi>Trifle</hi> at Your <hi>Feet,</hi> and bid You good morrow by the Name of <hi>Patron,</hi> which I hope You will bear with <hi>Patience,</hi> not only for my ſake, but as You do an hard <hi>Frost,</hi> or the Mid-ſummer <hi>Heats,</hi> or the Autumnal <hi>Faintings</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> For this is no more than one of the common <hi>Calamities</hi> incident to <hi>human Life,</hi> and the <hi>natural Inconvenience</hi> of being an <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>Friend.</hi> Yet when I call it worthleſs and Trifle; two very ill Names to make a Preſent withal, I mean it only with reſpect to the tranſcendent <hi>Merit</hi> of Him, to whom it is offered, to the ſmalneſs of it's <hi>Bulk,</hi> and the greater <hi>meanneſs</hi> and <hi>littleneſs</hi> of the <hi>Writer,</hi> who hath ſcarce any thing elſe to value himſelf upon beſides Mr. NIGHTINGALE's kind and charitable <hi>Opinion;</hi> otherwiſe for the <hi>Subject</hi> there can be nothing greater than that which is concerning that <hi>auſpitious Birth</hi> with which impatient <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> were ſo long in labour; in which ſo many <hi>Predictions</hi> and <hi>Propheſies</hi> were fulfilled, ſo many <hi>Mystic Types</hi> and <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:102592:5"/> anſwered, ſo many and ſo coſtly <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> and <hi>Expiations</hi> ended; and for my <hi>Management</hi> of it, I am ſo far from being one of thoſe that do <hi>magnificè ſentire</hi> of themſelves, eſpecially without, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as moſt of thoſe <hi>magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Opiniators</hi> do, That all I dare pretend to ſay concerning it, is only this, that I have endeavoured to do ſomething, which may in ſome meaſure <hi>excuſe</hi> and <hi>justifie</hi> Your <hi>Friendſhip</hi> to me.</p>
            <p>Particularly what I have written in the <hi>First Part</hi> of this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> concerning <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Saviours</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concerning <hi>Hobed</hi> and <hi>Jeſse,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> as having all of them in their Names or Offices, or both, a <hi>preparatory Alluſion</hi> to the <hi>Coming</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the <hi>quality</hi> of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> of his <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> is I think ſo plain and ſo convincing to any Man, that ſhall conſider thoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> ſingly, and by themſelves, and much more all of them in <hi>Confederacy</hi> together, That I am confident, there is no Man, who hath ſeriouſly conſider'd with himſelf, how full of <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Symbols</hi> the <hi>Old Testament</hi> is, both as to the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> that are contained in it, but will be forced to
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:102592:5"/> confeſs, what I without much <hi>Vanity</hi> may affirm to be true, That it is no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Service</hi> which is done to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Perſon,</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to <hi>Religion</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>There may yet perhaps be ſome <hi>Scruple</hi> concerning the <hi>Etymology</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> which I have made to be as much as <hi>Dod,</hi> or <hi>The Beloved;</hi> but as it cannot be queſtioned, but <hi>Dod</hi> is a very proper <hi>Contraction</hi> of <hi>Daoud,</hi> and that <hi>Doudaim,</hi> a Word of the <hi>Dual Form</hi> in the Story of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes</hi> is as much as <hi>Daoudaim;</hi> ſo it can as little be doubted, that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Daoud</hi> are exactly the ſame, only that the former is more uſually the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Form, as the latter is the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and yet there are not wanting other Words of exactly the ſame <hi>Form</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew Bibles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as <hi>Nagid,</hi> a Participial <hi>Noun</hi> for a <hi>Captain</hi> or <hi>Commander</hi> from the <hi>Adverb <hi>Neged,</hi>
               </hi> and ſo alſo <hi>Phakid</hi> or <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koud</hi> are indifferently uſed, for a <hi>Viſitor, Intendant</hi> or <hi>Inſpector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Second Part,</hi> which is a <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Chastity</hi> of the <hi>Virgin-Mother,</hi> againſt the <hi>Jewiſh Cavils</hi> and <hi>Miſinterpretations,</hi> I ſee not that it is poſſible that any thing ſhould be plainer than that <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>

From whence ſuch Abſurdities as theſe would follow; That the Fathers begetting the Son, was nothing but one Name or Notion or Mode of the Deity's begetting another; or elſe the ſame Deity under one Notion, begetting it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another Notion. And when again the Son or Word, and not the Father, is ſaid to have been incarnated, and to have ſuffered Death for us upon the Croſs; That it was nothing but a meer Logical Notion or Mode of the Deity, that was incarnate and ſuffered, or elſe the whole of the Deity under one particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Mode only.</hi>

            <p>It would have been very well <hi>ſi ſic omnia dixiſset,</hi> although in this very Citation, there be ſufficient matter for a very juſt Reprehenſion; For, by the <hi>Dr</hi>'s Favour, the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Doctrine is by no means a Conſequence of this <hi>Propoſition, That there is but one</hi> Hypoſtaſis, <hi>or ſingular, individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Eſſence of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſo far as the <hi>Divinity</hi> of all the <hi>Three Perſons</hi> is concerned; for the <hi>divine</hi> Nature in them all is, to uſe his own way

            <p>But ſo extremely cautious was the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Doctor</hi> of running into the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> That he not only denys the <hi>Three Perſons</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> to have <hi>One ſingular, existent Eſsence,</hi> but to avoid an Aſſertion, which to him ſeems to be ſo full of abſurdity, and the more effectually to baffle <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> which ſays there is no God, he tells us, if we will believe him, <hi>That there are Three,</hi> They are his own Words let him ſpeak for himſelf, <hi>pag. 604. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from hence, that theſe reputed Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Fathers, who were not a few, were far from thinking the Three Hypostaſes of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to have the ſame ſingular, existent Eſsence; they ſuppoſing them to have no otherwiſe one and the ſame Eſsence of the Godhead in them, nor to be one God, than three individual Men, have one common ſpecifical Eſsence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in them, and are all one Man. But as this Trinity came afterwards to be decryed for Tritheistic; ſo in the room thereof started there up that other of Perſons Numerically the ſame, or having all one and the ſame ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,

            <p>The notion of three <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Beings, is therefore an Abſurd and Fooliſh Notion, not only becauſe it makes three Gods to no purpoſe, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:102592:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> in any one which is not in the other, but alſo becauſe it is an impoſſible one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bargain. For to the notion of this <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Being the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> does of neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; wherefore in the caſe of <hi>three Gods,</hi> that is, three <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Numerically diſtinct, although ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſame, there muſt alſo be <hi>three <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitary</hi> or <hi>Omnipreſent Natures</hi> at the ſame time, ſo that they muſt of neceſſity imbibe and penetrate each other, by ſuch a kind of knack, as the Doctour out of the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> is pleaſed to call <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Doctour was not inſenſible how very invidious it muſt needs appear, to charge the <hi>Orthodox Fathers,</hi> and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelf, with aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Three Gods Numerically diſtinct, and therefore, though he was reſolved to lay it home upon them, partly to expoſe that Doctrine as it deſerves, and partly to ſhow the abſurdity of a ſingular exiſtent Eſſence Numerically the ſame in three ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which he would have us believe to have been ſo great, that the Fathers ran into <hi>Polytheiſm</hi> to avoid it, and by both of theſe means to open a fair paſſage for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm</hi>
               <pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:102592:16"/> to enter in, and take poſſeſſion of the minds of his Readers; yet he draws off and on by very Artificial Movements; for thus he tells us after a Multitude of Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as his manner is, <hi>p. 606. From all which it is unqueſtionably evident, that</hi> Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius <hi>did not by the word</hi> Homoouſios <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that which hath the ſame Singular and Numerical Eſſence with another, but the ſame common, generical or ſpecifical only; and conſequently that he conceived the Son to be co-eſſential or conſubſtantial with the Father, after that manner,</hi> that is, in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> he conceived the Father and the Son to be two ſeveral and diſtinct <hi>Gods,</hi> and again, <hi>p.</hi> 612. (which is falſly marked 596) he hath theſe words: <hi>And now upon all theſe conſiderations, our</hi> Platonic Chriſtian <hi>would conclude, that the</hi> Orthodox Trinity <hi>of the</hi> Antient Chriſtian Church, <hi>did herein agree with the genuinely</hi> Platonic Trinity, <hi>that it was not</hi> Monoouſian; <hi>one ſole ſingular Eſſence, under three Notions, Conceptions or Modes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but three</hi> Hypoſtaſes <hi>or</hi> Perſons, <hi>as likewiſe the right</hi> Platonic Trinity <hi>does agree with the</hi> Antient Orthodox Chriſtians <hi>in this, that it is not</hi> Heteroouſian <hi>but</hi> Homoouſian, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſential or Conſubſtantial; none of their</hi> three Hypoſtaſes <hi>being Creatures or particular Beings
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:102592:16"/> made in time, but all of them</hi> Unconceived Eternal <hi>and</hi> Infinite. And this I think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain is to repreſent the <hi>Orthodox Trinity,</hi> as conſiſting of three ſeveral <hi>Deities,</hi> or <hi>Divine Subſtances</hi> Numerically diſtinct, but ſpecifically the ſame, which is the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of all thoſe cramp words, that they are <hi>Homoouſian,</hi> that is, ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Co-eſſential and Conſubſtantial, not <hi>Monoouſian</hi> nor <hi>Tautoouſian,</hi> that is Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically the ſame, nor <hi>Heteroouſian,</hi> that is, ſpecifically or generically different from each other, and this, I take it, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Orthodox Trinity;</hi> but he goes on, and I muſt follow him, <hi>Notwithſtanding all which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it muſt be granted, that though this</hi> Homoouſiotes, <hi>or Co-eſſentiallity of the three Perſons in the</hi> Trinity, <hi>does imply them to be all God, yet does it not follow from thence of neceſſity, that they are therefore one God.</hi> No, by no means, but it follows unavoidably, that they are <hi>three Gods,</hi> and that is it which the <hi>Doctor</hi> would intimate when he tells us that it does not follow from thence of neceſſity, that they are one God; implying that the contrary does manifeſtly follow, and ſo good Night to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> a Doctrine which ran the reputed <hi>Orthodox Fathers,</hi> by which it is
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:102592:17"/> implyed, that they were not really ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many abſurdities, and ſo foul mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes: But this is not all; <hi>What then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall we conclude that</hi> Athanaſius <hi>himſelf alſo entertained that opinion before mentioned and exploded; of the</hi> three Perſons <hi>in the</hi> Trinity, <hi>being but</hi> three Individuals <hi>under the ſame ſpecies (as</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy) <hi>and having no other natural</hi> Unity, <hi>or</hi> Identity <hi>then Specifical only? Indeed ſome have confidently faſtned this upon</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>becauſe in thoſe</hi> Dialogues <hi>of the</hi> Trinity, <hi>publiſhed amongst his works, and there Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled to him, the ſame is groſly owned, and in defence thereof, this abſurd</hi> Paradox <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that</hi> Peter, Paul <hi>and</hi> Timothy, <hi>though they be</hi> three Hypoſtaſes, <hi>yet are not to be accounted</hi> three Men, <hi>but only then, when they Diſſent from one another, or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in</hi> Will <hi>or</hi> Opinion. <hi>But it is certain, from ſeveral paſſages in thoſe</hi> Dialogues <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they could not be written by</hi> Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius, <hi>and there hath been alſo another Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found for them,</hi> to wit, <hi>Maximus</hi> the <hi>Martyr.</hi> And this is wonderful pleaſant; <hi>Indeed ſome have confidently faſtened this upon</hi> Athanaſius, as if the baſhful <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,</hi> whoſe <hi>Chin</hi> muſt be acknowledged to be very <hi>Modeſt</hi> and <hi>Maidenly,</hi> whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Nay, <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this</hi> (for you muſt know the <hi>Doctour</hi> did not bring off <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> but
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:102592:18"/> with a deſign to bring him on again) <hi>thus much muſt not be denied by us, that</hi> Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, <hi>in thoſe others his reputedly genuine Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, doth ſometimes approach ſo near here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (that is, to the making the</hi> Unity <hi>of the</hi> Three Perſons <hi>to be</hi> Specifical <hi>only) that he lays no ſmall ſtreſs upon this</hi> Homoouſiotes, <hi>this</hi> Co-eſſentiality <hi>and</hi> common Nature <hi>of the</hi> Godhead, <hi>to all the</hi> three Perſons, <hi>in order to their being</hi> one God: And indeed the Citations by him thereafter immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately produced, do ſufficient prove, that he did ſometimes lay the whole ſtreſs and weight of the matter upon it; but yet not with ſo much ſteadineſs and reſolution, but that <hi>p.</hi> 614. he begins to repent his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for there the <hi>Doctour</hi> tells us, <hi>That</hi> Athanaſius <hi>elſewhere plainly implyeth, that this common Eſſence or Nature of the</hi> Godhead, <hi>is not ſufficient alone, to make all the three</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſes <hi>one</hi> God, <hi>as in his</hi> Fourth Oration <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the</hi> Arians, <hi>where he tells us, that his</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>of</hi> Divine Hypoſtaſes <hi>cannot therefore be accounted</hi> Three Gods <hi>nor</hi> Three Principles, <hi>becauſe they are not reſembled by him to</hi> Three Original Suns, <hi>but only to the</hi> Sun <hi>and its</hi> Splendor, <hi>and the</hi> Light <hi>from both.

For the <hi>Splendor</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> are but two words, as I take it, for one and the ſame thing, and ſo we have loſt one <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> already, and what if the <hi>Splendor</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhould not be really diſtinguiſht neither? What then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of this excellent compariſon? For certain it is, that the <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Splendor</hi> is not in it ſelf a real <hi>exiſtent</hi> thing, but only the reſult or effect of the preſſure of the ſubtle matter in the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> upon the <hi>Viſionary Organs</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:102592:19"/> affected with it; it is a relative or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional appearance, reſulting from the preſſure of that ſubtle matter, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a <hi>Nerve</hi> or <hi>Organ</hi> rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive that preſſure, and this impreſſion, if it be ſtrong and indiſtinct, it is called <hi>Splendor,</hi> if it be more gentle and diſtinct it hath the Name of <hi>Light,</hi> but now certainly no Man ever affirmed that the preſſure, and the <hi>Body</hi> preſſing, are in reality different from one another, any more then a ſhape or colour, and the Body ſhaped or coloured can be; and by the ſame reaſon the <hi>Sun</hi> and its <hi>Splendor</hi> or <hi>Light</hi> have not any <hi>real,</hi> but only an <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, relative</hi> or <hi>notional diſtinction,</hi> ſo that whatever becomes of the <hi>Rhetorick</hi> of this Compariſon, it is certain that it ſavours neither of a ſound <hi>Philoſopher</hi> nor a ſound <hi>Divine.</hi> But it is ſtill more expreſs againſt this <hi>Specific Identity,</hi> what the <hi>Doctor,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after alledges out of his <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>the many that are led by new</hi> Names <hi>and</hi> Authorities. It is true, he produceth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places where the word <hi>Homoouſios</hi> is without queſtion to be underſtood of a <hi>Specifical</hi> Unity, but what is that to the purpoſe? Does it therefore follow that it is never uſed otherwiſe? If he had given a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and compleat Induction of all the places where this word is uſed in any <hi>Greek Writer,</hi> and ſhown that in every one, it could not be underſtood otherwiſe then of a <hi>Specific Identity,</hi> this had been a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate concluſion, but to ſay of a word that
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:102592:33"/> may have divers ſignifications, that in ſome places it is uſed altogether in one ſenſe, and therefore there is no place where it hath any other, is an inference peculiar to the <hi>Doctors Logick,</hi> and ſhows him ſufficiently to have been a very unfit <hi>Architect</hi> to build an <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual System,</hi> an <hi>Intellectual Castle</hi> in the <hi>Ayr,</hi> he ſhould have called it, unleſs it were built upon more ſolid Foundations, and had more ſubſtantial Pillars to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>Well, but <hi>Petavius</hi> told him ſo, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did he, and what if he did? what then? muſt we <hi>believe</hi> every thing that <hi>Petavius</hi> tells us? why then <hi>we</hi> muſt <hi>believe</hi> that <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> is true, and that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> is <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> in ſeparating from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for there is no doubt but <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius</hi> would have determined affirmatively upon theſe queſtions, as often as any one had put them to him: Nay, <hi>but</hi> Petavius <hi>was a</hi> Man <hi>well skilled in</hi> Eccleſiaſtic Antiquity, ſo he was, and ſo is not the <hi>Doctor</hi> who pretends to follow him, but yet nothing hinders but both may be deceived; for <hi>Petavius</hi> was neither <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> and if he had been both of theſe at once, yet there is a Peſtilent <hi>Hereſie</hi> ſprung up in theſe Northern parts, that will have both of theſe to be liable to Errour, and
<pb n="lxiv" facs="tcp:102592:34"/> if <hi>Petavius</hi> be deceived the <hi>Doctor</hi> muſt too, for they are <hi>Bithus</hi> and <hi>Bachius, Hand</hi> and <hi>Glove,</hi> an <hi>Original</hi> and a <hi>Tranſcript,</hi> an <hi>Author</hi> and a <hi>Plagiary,</hi> ſo that if <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> be blind, it follows unavoidably, that the <hi>Intellectual Syſtemer</hi> muſt wink hard for Company, and ſo they are both in danger of the Ditch; I do not mean <hi>Democritus</hi> his Ditch, at the bottom of which the Truth was ſuppoſed to lie, but of the Ditch of Errour and Hallucination.</p>
            <p>But after all, perhaps the <hi>Doctors</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory may fail him, for is he ſure that he had this notion from <hi>Petavius;</hi> why true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the matter comes to be ſifted to the bottom, <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> does not prove ſo tall as our <hi>Enformant</hi> firſt took him to be, for by the <hi>Oath</hi> he hath taken, he can ſay no more then that <hi>Petavius</hi> intimated thus much, <hi>p.</hi> 605. but how did he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate it? O 'tis no matter for that! Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, you know Sir, may be made a thouſand ways, which it would be tedious at preſent to recount, and if this were but one of them it is enough, as a Man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion will tell you, there are ſeveral Roads to Heaven, a Man might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken lately a very convenient opportunity of going thither through <hi>Turkey,</hi> in the

<pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:102592:54"/> wherein the ſtrength of it lay, but that on the contrary they did not argue <hi>ad idem,</hi> and that according to them, it was no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument at all, is at once precarious and rude into the bargain, and is almoſt like the monſtrous abſurdity of the <hi>Epicurean Doctrine,</hi> that affirms all things to have come by chance, notwithſtanding all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrokes, appearances and ſignatures of the moſt exquiſite <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Skill.</hi>

            <p>The ſecond thing which I had in my mind, was that Miracle of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> which we find recorded, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 12. where <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> ſpeaks thus to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon, Sun, ſtand thou ſtill in</hi> Gibeon <hi>and thou Moon in the Valley of</hi> Ajalon, and then it follows, <hi>v. 13, 14. And the Sun ſtood ſtill and the Moon stayed until the People had avenged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Enemies,</hi> 
               <q>is not this written in the Book of <hi>Jaſher?</hi> ſo the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtood ſtill in the midſt of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and haſted not to go down, about a whole <hi>day,</hi> and there was no <hi>day</hi> like that before or after it, that the <hi>Lord</hi> hearkened unto the <hi>voice</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> fought for <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

<pb n="cxx" facs="tcp:102592:63"/> Conception; (viz.</hi>) ſeveral things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame ſingular Eſsence;</hi>
               </q> and here, though the <hi>Doctor</hi> did not diſtinguiſh ſo nicely as he ought to have done, betwixt <hi>things</hi> and <hi>perſons,</hi> yet I will grant him thus much, that <hi>ſeveral things</hi> being ſuppoſed to be <hi>ſeveral,</hi> are at the ſame time what they are <hi>Numerically</hi> by themſelves; and are <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically</hi> dictinct from <hi>one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet it does not follow, but that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons may all have the ſame <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Divine Substance,</hi> tho' to make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>perſons</hi> in this caſe, there be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite an acceſſion of ſome <hi>individuating Circumſtances</hi> or <hi>Properties,</hi> which ſhall be ſuperadded to the <hi>common Nature;</hi> and this is a great errour of which the <hi>Doctor,</hi> is guilty, if it be conſiſtent with the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his humor to endure to be told of his faults, becauſe ſeveral things cannot be the ſame (which is no ſuch very deep and profound <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> for how can they be <hi>ſeveral</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> at the ſame time) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſeveral Perſons</hi> indued with <hi>ſeveral</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuating <hi>differences</hi> cannot be partakers of the ſame <hi>common nature,</hi> which is falſe, as I will now immediately ſhow you, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with all imaginable caution, that the <hi>intellectual Syſtem</hi> being a wild coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="cxxi" facs="tcp:102592:63"/> and very full of woods; I may not unadviſedly fall into an <hi>Ambuſcade,</hi> by the following well weigh'd and well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I ſay, that that which is in it ſelf <hi>one,</hi> cannot be conceived as <hi>three</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that thoſe things which are in themſelves diſtinctly <hi>three,</hi> cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as <hi>one</hi> without compoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely and immutably perfect, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſimple and uncompounded, uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diviſion on the one hand or compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> I underſtand that <hi>ſimple, ſimilar,</hi> and <hi>Omnipreſent Divine Subſtance</hi> or ſpace, endued with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>power, goodneſs</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> whoſe parts, by reaſon of the <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> of the whole, are even by cogitation inſeparable from each other, or that <hi>Omnipreſent Divine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> which is as much and more ſimply <hi>one,</hi> in and with it ſelf, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecondary or derivative life can be, being all over nothing elſe but <hi>one entire Will, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Goodneſs, Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Power</hi> of <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Production,</hi> which being only that which is truly and
<pb n="cxxii" facs="tcp:102592:64"/> properly <hi>God,</hi> is therefore called <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> as being the moſt ſimple in it ſelf, and alſo the <hi>ſource</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> in the two ſubordinate <hi>Perſons,</hi> for the <hi>Perſons</hi> are not equally perfect as to their whole nature, although the <hi>Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> which makes them all to be <hi>God,</hi> be in all <hi>three Numerically</hi> and <hi>individually</hi> the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> by <hi>God the Son</hi> I underſtand the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the <hi>humane Nature,</hi> with the <hi>Divine Subſtance,</hi> which <hi>Divine Substance</hi> being endued and furniſhed with a <hi>life by it ſelf,</hi> is for that reaſon a <hi>Perſon by it ſelf,</hi> ſimply and abſtractly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for this is the moſt general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive notion of a <hi>Perſon,</hi> that it is a being endued with <hi>life,</hi> or with <hi>ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs</hi> or <hi>ſelf-ſenſation,</hi> to which <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life</hi> the <hi>Human</hi> being added, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influenced, animated and acted by it, and vitally united to it; there ariſes from hence a compound life, which is diſtinct from the ſimple (which is a life by it ſelf, without the acceſſion of the other,) and if a <hi>life</hi> and a <hi>perſon</hi> be the very ſame, then <hi>another ſort</hi> of <hi>life</hi> makes <hi>another ſort</hi> of <hi>Perſon,</hi> and <hi>another ſort</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="cxxiii" facs="tcp:102592:64"/> is <hi>another</hi> perſon, that is a <hi>compound</hi> Perſon, which is no more the ſame with <hi>ſimple,</hi> then <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>compoſition</hi> are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſame.</p>
            <p>But to make the ſolidity of this notion the more plainly to appear, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that though theſe two natures, the <hi>Divine</hi> and the <hi>Human</hi> are always vitally <hi>united</hi> to one another, ſo as they feel and enjoy the ſame common life, yet there are ſome caſes to be met with, wherein the <hi>Father,</hi> that is the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Simple Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> acts as a Perſon diſtinctly by it ſelf, without the concurrence of the <hi>Human</hi> with it, and there are others wherein they act in concurrence together, as if they had but <hi>one Will, one <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding, one ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and <hi>undivided Power</hi> of <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Heads there are the following particulars unqueſtionably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> when the <hi>Father</hi> is ſaid to <hi>beget</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> to be <hi>begotten,</hi> which he did from all <hi>Eternity</hi> by way of Emanation, as it is very eaſie for any Man to conceive he might do, for whatſoever is not in it ſelf impoſſible and contradictory to be done or performed, is a poſſible object of the
<pb n="cxxiv" facs="tcp:102592:65"/> 
               <hi>Divine Power,</hi> and was ſo without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was always abſolutely and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect, and by conſequence the ſphere of poſſibility, to which it is coextended, (for there is nothing poſſible which is not ſo a <hi>Divine Power</hi>) was from all <hi>Eternity</hi> exactly the ſame, though there had not been that <hi>eternal congruity</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> which there appears to have been in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> to the production of the <hi>Human,</hi> by that means, as it were, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie and enjoy it ſelf in its moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect image and reſemblance, and the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> when he is ſaid to have begotten the <hi>Son,</hi> it is not by any means ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if <hi>one Divine Subſtance</hi> could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>another,</hi> which is the very height of <hi>Non-ſenſe</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> into the bargain; but theſe two things are manifeſtly couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under it, and to be underſtood by it; <hi>First,</hi> that the <hi>Father</hi> that is the <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>ſimilar, ubiquitary Divine Subſtance,</hi> did from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> by way of emanation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that <hi>Human ſoul</hi> or <hi>Perſonality,</hi> which was the pre-exiſting <hi>ſoul</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> before his <hi>Incarnation</hi> and before all <hi>Worlds,</hi> being <hi>the firſt born of every</hi> Creature.</p>
            <pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:102592:65"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> he did likewiſe from all <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> conſtitute a <hi>vital <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> betwixt his own <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>ubiquitary Substance,</hi> and this <hi>eternally begotten</hi> or <hi>emanatively produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Human Soul,</hi> ſo as they were made to feel and enjoy one another, and where ever there is an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>ſelf-conſciouſneſs</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal enjoyment</hi> of each others <hi>life,</hi> ſo as the <hi>human life</hi> does at the ſame time parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate and ſhare in the <hi>Divine,</hi> this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conſtitute one common perſon, reſulting from the <hi>vital <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>Human Nature,</hi> into this common life and mutual enjoyment; for an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>life</hi> is the moſt ſtrict, inſeparable, and indiviſible ſort of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> that can poſſibly be conceived, and yet, notwithſtanding, the <hi>Human Nature,</hi> though it were eternally produced, yet it did not nor could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly produce it ſelf, which is to ſuppoſe a thing or perſon to be before it is, neither did it or could it poſſibly <hi>unite</hi> it ſelf in that entire and cloſe manner with the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> but in both theſe reſpects, the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature</hi> is originally paſſive, though to the latter it may be ſuppoſed to concur by a conſent of <hi>Will</hi> though not of <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> that is, the <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Divine Subſtance</hi> is conſidered as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon acting by himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="cxxvi" facs="tcp:102592:66"/>
            <p>In the ſecond place, when the <hi>Father</hi> is ſaid to <hi>ſend</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> to be <hi>ſent,</hi> here the <hi>Father</hi> or the <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>ſelf-exiſting Divine Subſtance</hi> is to be conſidered as a Perſon by it ſelf, and acting apart from the <hi>Son</hi> who is ſaid to be <hi>ſent;</hi> for in the firſt place, the <hi>Divine Subſtance</hi> which is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitary</hi> and <hi>Omnipreſent,</hi> cannot be ſaid with reſpect unto it ſelf, either to <hi>ſend</hi> or to be <hi>ſent;</hi> for whatſoever is <hi>Omnipreſent,</hi> is at the ſame time conſidered as immoveable and quieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, there being no place into which it is poſſible for it to remove, and this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may not improbably be lookt upon as one <hi>eternal</hi> cauſe of the <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> that by reaſon of its <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> it is always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at reſt within it ſelf, it is impaſſible from it ſelf and from any thing without it, it being impoſſible it ſhould yield or give place to any impreſſions, or that it ſhould be capable of any motion, mutability or change, in which the very nature of true happineſs conſiſts, for <hi>perfect reſt</hi> and <hi>perfect peace</hi> go together,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is abſurd to ſay that <hi>one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Subſtance</hi> can ſend <hi>another;</hi> for this were to ſuppoſe a plurality of <hi>Gods,</hi> which hath been already ſufficiently exploded,
<pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:102592:66"/> beſides that to <hi>ſend</hi> implying a ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to <hi>be ſent</hi> a ſubjection, both of which are abſolutely impoſſible and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, with reſpect to <hi>two Divine</hi> or <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect ſubſtances</hi> compared together, it is likewiſe abſurd in this reſpect to affirm of <hi>one Divine Subſtance,</hi> that it ſends or commands, or that it is obedient to, or is ſent by another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> though the <hi>Human Nature</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be ſo intimately twiſted with, and ſo vitally <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited,</hi> as is plain in every <hi>human</hi> compoſition conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> and that there is a <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er congruity</hi> of one <hi>immaterial Nature</hi> to <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> then there can be of that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>life</hi> and <hi>activity,</hi> to that which is utterly <hi>deſtitute</hi> and <hi>devoid</hi> of <hi>both,</hi> which is the caſe of matter, which yet by its <hi>union</hi> with an <hi>immaterial ſubſtance,</hi> is made to <hi>taſte</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> it ſelf, to become the <hi>ſubject</hi> and <hi>ſeat,</hi> either of <hi>pleaſure</hi> or <hi>pain,</hi> and to concur with the other towards the conſtituting of a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Perſon,</hi> reſulting from them both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> upon ſuppoſition that <hi>one life</hi> is capable of being impreſt and influenced by <hi>another,</hi> as there is more reaſon that it ſhould, then that that, which is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of life ſhould be capable of the ſame impreſſions, this is enough to conſtitute <hi>one common perſon;</hi> for by a <hi>perſon</hi> nothing
<pb n="cliii" facs="tcp:102592:79"/> elſe is meant but a <hi>ſelf-conſcious nature,</hi> and therefore, where there is in <hi>two perſonali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> a <hi>mutual</hi> enjoyment or feeling of each <hi>others life;</hi> there ariſes a <hi>compound perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> from the mutual <hi>reciprocation, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>imbibition</hi> of <hi>two</hi> ſeveral <hi>lives,</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon and influencing each other, and being brought to a perfect <hi>Harmony,</hi> and entire conſent of <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> and it is ſufficient in this caſe, that the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties</hi> in the <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>two natures,</hi> to make up and conſtitute the <hi>ſecond perſon</hi> in the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> are not greater, no nor ſo great neither, as thoſe in the <hi>union</hi> of our <hi>own ſoul</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> of which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are intimately and perfectly <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is no way to expound ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> with any plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or ſhew of <hi>truth,</hi> but by admitting ſuch an <hi>union</hi> as this, which ſeems in thoſe places to be ſo plainly aſſerted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> in the <hi>Sympathies</hi> of <hi>friendſhip,</hi> whether in joy or grief, and in the mutual complacency and ſatisfaction, which entire friends experience in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and company of each other, in their <hi>common ſentiments, common wiſhes</hi> and <hi>common deſigns,</hi> there is ſomething very
<pb n="cliv" facs="tcp:102592:80"/> like this <hi>union</hi> which we contend for, though it be far from being ſo perfect and entire.</p>
            <p>It being therefore ſo rational, to believe that there may be ſuch a <hi>perſonal union</hi> of <hi>two immaterial natures</hi> together, to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> that other of theſe <hi>two natures</hi> or <hi>perſons</hi> ſo <hi>united,</hi> to a <hi>certain, ſubtle, ſubeternal</hi> and <hi>aethereal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to conſtitute the <hi>third Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> which is called the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> muſt be admitted as a <hi>poſſible union,</hi> becauſe the <hi>vital union</hi> of an <hi>immaterial na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to a <hi>material,</hi> is no more then we do all of us every day experience in our ſelves, as hath been already obſerved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Father</hi> is the <hi>ſimple divine ſubſtance</hi> by <hi>himſelf,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> is the <hi>vital <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of an <hi>human ſoul</hi> to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an <hi>Aethereal</hi> and <hi>Emanative matter, vitally united</hi> to both the former. That which makes them all to be <hi>God,</hi> is the ſame <hi>Numerical Divine ſubſtance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them all, and that which makes the diſtinction of the <hi>Perſons,</hi> is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a <hi>Created immaterial nature,</hi> in the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> of a <hi>Created material one</hi> in the <hi>third,</hi> and the
<pb n="clv" facs="tcp:102592:80"/> ſubſtraction or preciſion of <hi>both</hi> of theſe in the <hi>firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Son</hi> is ſaid to be begotten of the <hi>Father,</hi> being <hi>a ſimilar, immaterial,</hi> and as it were, <hi>univocal effect</hi> of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to proceed from them <hi>both,</hi> becauſe, though the <hi>human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>ſubtle matter,</hi> which makes the <hi>body</hi> of that <hi>Perſon</hi> which is called the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> be both of them <hi>emanative</hi> and by conſequence <hi>eternal,</hi> yet the <hi>emanation</hi> ſeems more <hi>natural</hi> from <hi>one immaterial nature</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> then from <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material</hi> to <hi>material,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Son</hi> is at leaſt <hi>prior natura</hi> then the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> though not <hi>cognitione,</hi> and the <hi>ſubtle matter</hi> which is one part of the <hi>third Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> being <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> though from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> yet, in ſome ſenſe, for the ſake of the <hi>Son,</hi> as hath been already declared, and being alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the <hi>Father</hi> by a <hi>contemporary</hi> conſent of <hi>will</hi> in the <hi>Son,</hi> or in the <hi>human nature,</hi> though they be ſuppoſed <hi>contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to <hi>one another,</hi> yet this is enough to make it no improper way of expreſſion, to ſay, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> proceeded from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> though in this I do not juſtifie the heats on either ſide, between
<pb n="clvi" facs="tcp:102592:81"/> the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Churches,</hi> neither do I think the <hi>Schiſm</hi> to be the leſs inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe the <hi>Latins,</hi> in a matter of this ſubtlety, were in the right.</p>
            <p>I do not deny but that the <hi>Father</hi> or the <hi>ſimple divine ſubstance,</hi> is <hi>always vitally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to the <hi>human nature</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and alſo to a certain <hi>ſubtle</hi> and <hi>aethereal matter,</hi> in that manner which hath been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; but yet notwithſtanding the <hi>real diſtinction</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> from the <hi>Son,</hi> or of the <hi>first Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity</hi> from the <hi>ſecond,</hi> is <hi>always</hi> as really and as clearly preſerved, as if in the <hi>first caſe</hi> there were no <hi>ſecond Perſon,</hi> or no <hi>vital union</hi> with the <hi>human nature,</hi> or as if in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> there were no <hi>third</hi> or no <hi>vital union</hi> of the <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>human nature,</hi> with the <hi>aethereal matter;</hi> for in the firſt place, as hath been already largely repreſented, there are ſome operations of the <hi>ſimple di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſubſtance,</hi> to which the <hi>human nature,</hi> being but finite, cannot adaequately extend, and in this caſe, that <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity conſidered as a <hi>Perſon</hi> acting by it ſelf, and in the <hi>ſecond,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal union</hi> of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>more immaterial nature</hi> to a <hi>material,</hi> yet there are ſome abſtracted <hi>operations</hi> wherein the <hi>immaterial ſubſtances</hi>
               <pb n="clvii" facs="tcp:102592:81"/> do perfectly withdraw themſelves, from any intercourſe or communication with matter, as is plain in thoſe operations of the <hi>human ſoul,</hi> which are purely <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,</hi> in which the <hi>animal, concupiſcibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="clviii" facs="tcp:102592:82"/> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſcription of the <hi>ſtrife</hi> and <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> between the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit, Rom. 7. 15. That which I do I allow not, for what I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I.</hi> Where it is manifeſt that the <hi>ſoul</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> conſidered by it ſelf in its moſt <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>abſtracted ſpeculation,</hi> is conſidered as <hi>one perſon,</hi> and as <hi>united</hi> and <hi>vitally interwoven</hi> with a <hi>body</hi> or <hi>vehicle</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> as another, and this is enough to ſhow that a <hi>compound</hi> and a <hi>ſimple perſon</hi> are by no means the <hi>ſame,</hi> or to defend the <hi>perſonality</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as diſtinct from the <hi>ſimple ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, that by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> nothing elſe is meant but the <hi>vital union</hi> of an <hi>ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal</hi> or <hi>ſubtle matter,</hi> to the <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>original divine ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> is clear not only from the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by which it is expreſſed in <hi>Hebrew <hi>Rouach</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus have I given, I hope, a plain and clear <hi>account</hi> of the <hi>hitherto</hi> accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>bleſſed Trinity,</hi> ſo as to make it <hi>conſonant</hi> to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> together, by which we ſhall at once gain a manifeſt <hi>advantage</hi> over the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> whoſe only ſcruple againſt it, is its puzling and unintelligible <hi>Nature,</hi> and over the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who fly for refuge to this <hi>Doctrine</hi> as their laſt <hi>Defence</hi> to vindicate the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> and the truth is, to ſwallow the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs whole without chewing, as many too credulous people are uſed to do, as if <hi>three</hi> could be <hi>one</hi> or <hi>one three,</hi> without compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

            <p>I do affirm to you, without any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of proteſtation, which commonly is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to beliefe, by a too fierce and violent endeavour to obtain it, that it was not any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of appearing Learned, before People that are not Judges of ſuch things, that was the occaſion of ſo intricate a diſcourſe, as this muſt needs ſeem to a Popular aſſembly, but only that I was ſo ſimple to believe, that things that were ſo plain to my ſelf, must needs be ſo to every body elſe, till I found by the complaints of ſuch as had but too much reaſon to be diſpleaſed at me, for going about, as they thought, to puzzle and confound them, that I was not underſtood; I beg their pardon with all my heart, though I have now no other reaſon to do it, then only that experience hath taught me more wit, and made me more ſenſible of my errour then I was, when I committed it, and if by what I have ſaid I have demonstrated more ſenſibly the Existence of a God, then others have done before me, I ask no other reward then that you would not laugh at my Infirmitie, of which no man is more ſeverely conſcious then my ſelf, and if you meet with any thing by which either you are edifyed or the truth aſserted; I aſcribe
<pb facs="tcp:102592:87"/> nothing to my ſelf, but to the <hi>giver of every good and perfect gift,</hi> and I deſire that God may have the Glory and his Church the benefit of my undertaking.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102592:91"/> only evil continually, that the Earth was Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt before God, and the Earth was filled with violence, that God looked upon the Earth, and behold it was corrupt; for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the Earth, ſo that it repented the Lord that he had made Man in the Earth, and it grieved him at his Heart:</hi> And yet in this very time as bad as it was, God did not only give Teſtimony to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by the works of the Creation, but alſo by living Witneſſes and expreſs Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who as it ſeems were aſſiſted and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an extraordinary Spirit, otherwiſe they would have wanted courage to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Meſſage in ſo degenerate and corrupt an Age, and ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us concerning <hi>Noah,</hi> who was the <hi>laſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> of Repentance to the old World, That <hi>Christ was put to death in the Fleſh, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit, by which alſo he went and Preached unto the Spirits in Priſon, which ſome time were diſobedient, when once the long ſuffering of God waited in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Ark was a preparing,</hi> where it is manifeſt that the <hi>Spirits in Priſon,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of thoſe <hi>diſobedient</hi> and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable Perſons, for whom <hi>the long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of God waited</hi> with ſo much patience <hi>in the days of</hi> Noah <hi>while the Ark was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And when God being provoked to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termity by the ſins of the old World, had brought a deluge upon them to deſtroy them, yet what was this Judgment it ſelf but a Sermon of Repentance and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe eight Perſons that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alive? And was not <hi>Noah</hi> ſpared in that Univerſal Calamity, as well that he might continue, as he did for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together after the Floud, to be an example to thoſe that lived with him, and to thoſe that were afterwards to be

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102592:93"/> by a particular Revelation or Voice from Heaven, or inward impulſe and motion of the Divine Spirit, to <hi>forſake his kindred and his Fathers Houſe,</hi> that he might be brought into cloſer engagements with his Maker, and enter into a new Covenant and Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him, and alſo from this, that in the Family of <hi>Nahor,</hi> who was the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Idolatry ſtill continued, as is manifeſt from the ſtory of <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> and if <hi>Lot,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Haran,</hi> and the Nephew of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were a Worſhipper of the true God, and had forſaken the ſuperſtitions and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Heathen, yet this is rather to be attributed to his Converſe and Friendſhip and Cohabitation with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to his being deſcended of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Covenant</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> entred into with God, was the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and in that there were theſe two things implied; <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Worſhip of the true God, in oppoſition to Idolatry; <hi>Secondly,</hi> the obſervation to all Perſonal vertues, in oppoſition to the gluttony and intemperance, the luxury and riot of the Heathen World.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 2.</hi> That the MESSIAS was to be <hi>Born</hi> of a VIRGIN.</head>
               <p>IN the former Chapter having clearly repreſented how careful and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous the Divine goodneſs and wiſdom have all along appeared, to preſerve and keep up a due ſenſe of themſelves, and of that infinitely perfect Subſtance to which they belong, for the better ordering and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, and how all things all the while have had a perpetual tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the <hi>laſt Prophet</hi> and the <hi>laſt Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that was to be introduced by him, to fill the minds of Men with a deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of him, and to render them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, if they did not give him that reception which was due to the greatneſs of his Character, and the dignity of his Perſon: I ſhall now diſcourſe more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the two parts into which the Text does naturally divide it ſelf, <hi>firſt,</hi> that it was neceſſary that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or the <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was to come, ſhould be <hi>born
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102592:99"/> of a Virgin, ſecondly,</hi> that he was to be <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the firſt of them, nothing can be plainer then that the <hi>Evangeliſts are</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and unanimous in the aſſerting of this truth, that the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus</hi> was born of a <hi>pure Virgin.</hi> So that nothing more remains to be ſaid upon this head, then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove that it was Typically or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically neceſſary that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall Conceive and bare a Son,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> to elude the force of ſo expreſs a Prophecy concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> have found out two evaſions ſince our Saviour's time, which if they were at all thought of, yet they were never obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in before: The <hi>firſt</hi> is this, that what we tranſlate <hi>Virgin</hi> is to be underſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently of <hi>any Woman</hi> whatſoever, not paſt the Years of Conception, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly what the <hi>Seventy Interpreters</hi> have tranſlated by <hi>Parthenos</hi> a word in <hi>Greek,</hi> that ſignifies a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>untainted Virgin,</hi> that the other <hi>Greek Interpreters,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſince our <hi>Saviours</hi> time, have tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more favourably to the opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Behold a young Woman or Damſel ſhall conceive;</hi> and in conſequence of this Notion, they have preſumed to tell
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102592:100"/> us farther, that this <hi>Prophecy</hi> was fulfilled in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> which could not poſſibly be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this <hi>Prophecy</hi> was written at ſome time or other, in the Reign of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who <hi>Reigned</hi> but ſixteen years in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereas <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> was <hi>five</hi> and <hi>twenty</hi> when he began to Reign, and conſequently muſt have lived <hi>nine</hi> years before <hi>Ahaz</hi> was advanced to the Kingdom. Beſides that, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> which is here interpreted a <hi>Virgin,</hi> hath the ſame ſignification in the <hi>Punic Language,</hi> which was almoſt the ſame with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> by the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who tells us expreſly, that <hi>Alma</hi> in the <hi>Punic</hi> was the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>peculiar Name</hi> of a <hi>Virgin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not all, there are other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which by the Interpretation of the <hi>Antient Jews,</hi> were conſtantly expounded in favour of this Doctrine, that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> was to be born of a pure Virgin that had never known Man, and ſuch is that of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 31. at the <hi>22d. Verſe, The Lord hath Created a new thing on the Earth, a Woman ſhall compaſs a Man, a Woman ſhall compaſs,</hi> that is, a <hi>Woman</hi> ſhall <hi>encloſe</hi> or be with Child of a <hi>Man;</hi> but now this was no ſuch ſtrange thing, if we underſtand it no otherwiſe then of the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> way of Generation; for certainly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102592:100"/> that was no <hi>new thing</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>'s time, it is therefore of neceſſity to be interpreted ſome way different from the courſe of Nature, and it cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be better expounded then of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> as the <hi>Ancient Rablins</hi> did certainly underſtand it, and applyed this Prophecy expreſly to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> in that firſt promiſe which was made of the <hi>Meſſias, The Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall bruiſe the Serpents Head;</hi> it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that this Prophecy or promiſe is to be underſtood particularly of the Woman, as ſhe is diſtinguiſhed and conſidered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Man, becauſe it is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her particularly, that God diſcourſes with the Serpent in that place, <hi>Gen. 3. 13. And the Lord God ſaid unto the Woman, what is it that thou haſt done? And the Woman ſaid the Serpent beguiled me and I did eat,</hi> upon which, <hi>v. 14. The Lord God ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Serpent, becauſe thou haſt done this, thou art curſed above all Cattle, and above every Beaſt of the Field, upon thy belly ſhalt thou go, and duſt ſhalt thou eat all the days of thy life, and I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed, it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel;</hi> and then it follows <hi>verſe 17. And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102592:101"/> unto</hi> Adam <hi>he ſaid, becauſe thou haſt hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the voice of thy Wife,</hi> &amp;c. From whence it is manifeſt that the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> are here diſtinguiſhed plainly from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and conſequently, that what was above propheſyed of the <hi>Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> muſt be underſtood of <hi>that Seed</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered <hi>apart</hi> from the <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to theſe Teſtimonies which have been already made uſe of by learned Men, and the two firſt of them interpreted of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves: I will now add ſome more which have not been taken notice of by any before; which will give an undeniable ſtrength to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of this truth, <hi>that the Meſſias was to be born of a Virgin;</hi> and the firſt thing which I ſhall inſtance in, ſhall be the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of <hi>Sarah,</hi> which was without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion Typical of that of the bleſſed Virgin, for <hi>Ifaac</hi> was a Type of <hi>Christ,</hi> as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, and his Fathers going about at the command of <hi>God</hi> to make him a Sacrifice upon the Altar, was a Type of that Sacrifice of the only begotten Son of <hi>God,</hi> which was in the fulneſs of time to be offered up for the ſins of the whole World.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, as by reaſon of the great <hi>joy</hi> that was conceived at his birth, after it had ceaſed to be with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> after the manner of Women, ſo alſo in this that he was the <hi>only Son</hi> of his aged Father, as our <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>only begotten</hi> of God, and therefore by <hi>Philo Byblius</hi> the Tranſlator of <hi>Sanchuniathon</hi> an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Phaenitian</hi> Writer, he is called <hi>Ieoud,</hi> which anſwers to the <hi>Hebrew <hi>Iachid,</hi>

                  </hi> an <hi>heap of Witneſs</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> was by <hi>Laban</hi> in the <hi>Syriac</hi> or <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Tongue ſtiled <hi>Iegar Sahadoutha,</hi> and in this an <hi>old Woman,</hi> ſo far ſtricken in Years, that ſhe was <hi>uncapable</hi> naturally to conceive, or to bear or bring forth any more Children, was a very <hi>proper</hi> Type of conception by a <hi>Virgin,</hi> ſince both of them are equally impoſſible by the courſe of Nature, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102592:103"/> depend wholly upon the Divine Power, which nothing hinders but it may exert it ſelf equally in one caſe as well as the other.</p>
               <p>And the ſame was true in the ſecond place concerning <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Mother of <hi>John,</hi> whom the Scripture declares expreſly to have been a forerunner of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for ſhe alſo was <hi>old,</hi> and ſo far beyond the leaſt thought or hopes of any iſſue to be deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from her, that <hi>Zachariah</hi> could not believe the meſſage of the Angel, when it was firſt delivered, <hi>Whereby ſhall I know this?</hi> ſaid he, <hi>For I am an old Man and my Wife well ſtricken in Years;</hi> and the Angel himſelf confeſſed that it was impoſſible by the courſe of nature, and that nothing but the immediate and miraculous Power of God was capable of bringing ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to paſs, in what he ſaith afterwards to the Bleſſed Virgin, <hi>Behold thy Couſin</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth <hi>ſhe hath alſo conceived a Son in her Old Age, and this is the ſixth month with her who was called barren, for with God nothing ſhall be impoſſible.</hi> But though <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might both of them be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Types and Forerunners of a <hi>Conceiving Virgin,</hi> becauſe of the natural inabilities for <hi>Conception,</hi> which were equal on both ſides, yet of any other <hi>young</hi> and <hi>teeming</hi> Woman, they could not, ſo that either we muſt ſay,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102592:103"/> that the <hi>Conceptions</hi> of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> were not Typical and Significative of that of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of our Lord, which hath been already ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or that the latter was as certainly a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>untainted Virgin,</hi> as that the two former had <hi>paſt</hi> the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Child bearing,</hi> and that it had <hi>ceaſed to be with them after the manner of a Women,</hi> and therefore it is obſervable, that as <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Son was by the Angel himſelf called by the Name of <hi>John,</hi> as much as to ſay, that he was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> by the <hi>Grace and Favour of God,</hi> when Nature was no longer able to bring ſo wonderful an effect to paſs, ſo is <hi>Sarah</hi> the Mother of <hi>Iſaac</hi> called by <hi>Sanchaniathon Annobert,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, ſhe that conceiveth or bringeth forth by grace, notwithſtanding the inabilities and decays of Nature, and they might all three in ſome reſpect and degree, as well <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>John</hi> as our very <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf, be ſaid to have been conceived by the <hi>overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or by the <hi>wonderful Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> working without and contrary to nature.</p>

               <p>My laſt Inſtance ſhall be taken from the Story of <hi>Lot</hi> and his two <hi>Daughters,</hi> a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which though if it were not Recorded in Scripture, and if all Scripture were not written for our Inſtruction, it might need an Apology; yet being to be found there and having ſo wholeſome and ſo inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive a Leſſon contained in it I ſhall made none for it, but only obſerve that from

               <p>So zealous and ſo tender hath the <hi>Church</hi> always been in aſſerting the honour of the Virgin Mother, that ſhe hath always<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her perpetual Virginity, as well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  </gap>, and the <hi>Latins</hi> of <hi>ſemper Virgo,</hi> and it is not reaſonable to conceive, that ſhe who was ſo honoured, ſo highly graced and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the overſhadowing of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> ſhould ever ſubmit to any mortal Embraces, neither is it reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a Man of ſo Pious a Character as <hi>Joſeph</hi> is always repreſented under, would ever have attempted any thing ſo prophane, or ſo extremely Sacrilegious as that may juſtly be interpreted to be, and the application of a paſſage in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> by that <hi>excellent Prelate</hi> ſo often appealed to, is extremely ingenious, and like the man that made it, <hi>Ezech. 44. 2. This Gate ſhall be ſhut, it ſhall not be opened, and no Man ſhall enter in by it, becauſe the Lord, the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath entered in by it, therefore it ſhall be ſhut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The only reaſonable objection againſt this truth, is contained firſt in thoſe words of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> concerning <hi>Joſeph, Matt.</hi> 1. 25. Joſeph <hi>Knew not</hi> Mary <hi>until ſhe had brought forth her firſt born;</hi> where <hi>Jeſus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called the <hi>firſt born,</hi> it ſeems to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, as if there were others who were born after him, but to this, to omit another
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102592:107"/> anſwer of that admirable Perſon, which in my opinion does either, not reach the buſineſs, or elſe is not ſatisfactory enough to convince the obſtinacy of contentious Men, there is another anſwer which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be withſtood, and that is, that there was a Sacrifice due for every <hi>firſt born</hi> of the <hi>Males,</hi> whether ever any other Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring were begotten or brought forth or no, and this was the expreſs Law of God, <hi>Sanctifie unto me all the firſt born, whatſoever openeth the Womb among the Children of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>both of Man and Beast it is mine,</hi> and in purſuance of this Law it was, that our Saviours <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>reputed Father</hi> brought him to <hi>Jeruſalem, to preſent him to the Lord, as it is written in the Law of the Lord, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Male that openeth the Womb, ſhall be called Holy to the Lord.</hi> So that he was brought to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the Law required, under the notion of a firſt born, whether there were a ſecond or a third or no.</p>
               <p>But <hi>ſecondly</hi> it is objected, that there is mention made in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of our Lord,</hi> but to this it is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that theſe may either be underſtood by the Sons of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> by ſome other Wife, eſpecially if the age of <hi>Joſeph</hi> were ſo great as <hi>Epiphanius hath reported,</hi> or in general,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102592:107"/> of any that were of the Relation and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, either of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> or of <hi>Joſeph</hi> his reputed <hi>Father:</hi> As <hi>Abraham</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lot</hi> his Brother, though in ſtrictneſs of ſpeech he was his Brothers Son, and <hi>Moſes</hi> called <hi>Miſhael</hi> and <hi>Elzaphan,</hi> the Sons of <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziel</hi> but of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as the <hi>ſame worthy Biſhop obſerves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this point of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> his being Born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> with obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, when they endeavour with ſo much care, and ſtudy to elude the force of ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative Texts, wherein this Doctrin is conſtantly aſſerted, do in effect confeſs, that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> was born, as the Goſpels have unanimouſly declared concerning him, of a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>undefiled Virgin,</hi> that had never known Man, for upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that they do not grant thus much, it would have been needleſs to ſtretch their wits, to evade the force of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, wherein it was foretold of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that he ſhould be born of a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> but the ready way would have been,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102592:108"/> to have affirmed according to the vulgar errour of the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, who lived in our Saviour's time, that he was the <hi>Son of Joſeph the Carpenter,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that not being born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> as the <hi>Prophets</hi> had <hi>foretold,</hi> he could not be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since it appears ſo plainly, by the extorted confeſſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>thoſe Jews,</hi> I mean, who ſince our Saviour's time, have endeavoured to elude the Prophecies concerning him, that he was indeed born, as we affirm and believe after a miraculous manner, of a <hi>Virgin;</hi> this ſhows plainly, according to their own extorted confeſſion, that he was certainly a moſt extraordinary Perſon, who was brought into the World by ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act of Providence, as was peculiar to himſelf; and it implies, that he was ſent into it upon ſome very important and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſion, and this, reflected back upon thoſe Prophecies that have been mentioned concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and compared with the Doctrine and the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Bleſsed Jeſus,</hi> makes it ſtill more probable, that they are to be underſtood of a <hi>Virgin, truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> ſo called, and that he was indeed the very Perſon whom
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102592:108"/> the Prophets foretold, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was expected in the fulneſs of time, and ſo the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Evaſions are baffled by themſelves, and from what they have granted to be true, they are in effect forced to confeſs that, which in words and in appearance they deny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> when there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Types antecedent to the birth of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which did ſo plainly preſignifie, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was indeed to be born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> which Types have not been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, or applied, ſo much as by any of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> or <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or by our Saviour himſelf, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> when it is plain and evident by many paſſages of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was expected by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time when our Saviour appeared, when there was no Man in that age that could compare or vye with him, for the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of his Life, or for the purity of his Doctrine, or for the greatneſs or the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his miracles, all theſe things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together, are a further atteſtation to the truth of what the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> have told us, that <hi>our Jeſus was indeed the Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>he was born of a Virgin;</hi> neither is there
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102592:109"/> any thing that gives greater ſtrength and authority to the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, then, by comparing the <hi>New Testament</hi> and the <hi>Old</hi> together, to find, that the Types as well as Prophecies of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> are ſo exactly anſwered by the events of the <hi>New,</hi> and that, in ſuch inſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have not been applied, or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together by our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, or by any of his <hi>Apostles,</hi> but that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contains within it ſelf a hidden Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Teſtimony, to its own undoubted authority and truth, which Providence did not think it fit to reveal and lay open, but to let it lye hid in darkneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment, as a reward to the pious curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch as ſhould afterwards diligently read and ſearch the Scriptures, and that in every age there might ſome new Evidence appear, for the further confirmation and aſſurance of the truth, and to render the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> the more inexcuſable, by the dayly encreaſing light that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to ſurround them.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102592:110"/> did call his Name <hi>Emanuel</hi> or no, and the anſwer to this queſtion is very eaſie, that ſhe did not, and that the Name given him at his Circumciſion, was not <hi>Imanuel</hi> but <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and this by the direction of the <hi>Angel himſelf,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>to ſave his People from their ſins,</hi> wherefore it is clear that theſe words, <hi>and ſhall call his Name</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, if they have any ſenſe at all, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood of his <hi>Name</hi> but of his <hi>Nature,</hi> and if ſo, then all that I deſire is granted, that he was by <hi>Nature God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> and this is the meaning of that Phraſe, <hi>and ſhall call his Name</hi> Emanuel, that is, ſhe ſhall acknowledge him to be God and worſhip him as ſuch, and if it can be proved that ever ſhe did ſo, then it is plain that this Prophecy was exactly fulfilled, and that here is all that can be deſired for the explication of this place, and what elſe, I beſeech you, is, or can be, the meaning of the firſt words of her Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Song, <hi>My Soul doth magnifie the Lord, and my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour, for he hath regarded the lowlineſs of his Hand Maiden,</hi> that is, God that is about to take <hi>Human Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Human Nature</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, hath alſo graciouſly and mercifully decreed to make me his poor Handmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102592:110"/> and lowly Servant, the happy Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conveying ſo great a Bleſſing to the World, or elſe we may interpret thoſe words, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall Conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his Name</hi> Emanuel, after this manner; <hi>ſhe ſhall Conceive and bare a Son,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a Son,</hi> as ſhall be as <hi>really God</hi> as he is <hi>Man;</hi> for in the <hi>Hebrew Idiom</hi> things are ſaid to be <hi>called,</hi> what <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are,</hi> as in that paſſage concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Mother of <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, This is the ſixth month with her who was called Barren,</hi> that is, who was <hi>really</hi> ſo; for the Text tells us likewiſe, that <hi>ſhe was old and well striken in years,</hi> and the Angel acknowledged that her Conception was impoſſible by the courſe of Nature; and ſo in that paſſage of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made uſe of to another purpoſe, in the former part of this diſcourſe, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his Shoulder, and his Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, and the Prince of Peace;</hi> that is, he ſhall <hi>really</hi> be all theſe things, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he ſhall be the <hi>Everlaſting Father</hi> and the <hi>Mighty God;</hi> or in the Language of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102592:111"/> the <hi>Socinians, Deus ille altiſſimus,</hi> the God of <hi>Melchiſedek, the moſt high God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is my firſt argument drawn from the conſideration of the words of my Text, <hi>and ſhall call his Name</hi> Immanuel, neither was that the Name he was called by at his Circumciſion, or the Name by which he was known either to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or the <hi>Jews,</hi> or any other, ſo that this place cannot poſſibly be interpreted of his Name, but Nature, and is as much as to ſay in other words, that he was <hi>really God</hi> as well as <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> he that <hi>raiſed</hi> up <hi>himſelf</hi> from the Grave, after his body had lain there for three days together, was <hi>really God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> but our <hi>Jeſus raiſed himſelf</hi> by his own Power, from the dead, after he had lain buried in the Grave for three days together, therefore he was <hi>really God</hi> as well as <hi>Man.</hi> That this could not be done by any <hi>Human Power,</hi> is a thing that cannot, without great folly and ſtupidity, be queſtioned or denied, that he did it by his own Power, is equally manifeſt from his own words, <hi>Destroy this Temple,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and in three days I will raiſe it up,</hi> which words the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> tells us, he ſpake of <hi>the Temple of his Body,</hi> wherefore, if he were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102592:111"/> raiſed from the Dead by the Power of God, conſidered as a Power diſtinct from that, with which he was <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> inveſted himſelf; then it is falſe what he affirms that he <hi>himſelf,</hi> in the compaſs of <hi>three days,</hi> would <hi>raiſe up</hi> and renew the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Body,</hi> after it had been deſtroyed, but if he did it himſelf, as he affirms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have done, then he was <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> inveſted with that Power by which it was performed, which Power, ſince it could be no leſs then ſuch as was <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly Divine,</hi> it follows unavoidably that he was <hi>really God</hi> as well as <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, in the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the dead, that Prophecy was fulfilled, <hi>Thou ſhalt not leave my Soul in Hell, nor ſuffer thine Holy one to ſee Corruption,</hi> which words are the words of Chriſt, ſpeaking by the Mouth and Spirit of the <hi>Pſalmiſt to God the Father,</hi> and that they were Prophetical of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus from the dead, we have the expreſs authority of St. <hi>Peter</hi> for it, in the <hi>2d.</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the 29, 30, and 31. <hi>verſes, Men and Brethren,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let me freely ſpeak unto you of the Patriarch</hi> David, <hi>that he is both dead and buried, and his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre is with us unto this day, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prophet and knowing that God had ſworn
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102592:112"/> with an Oath to him, that of the fruit of his Loins according to the Fleſh, he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on his Throne, he, ſeeing this before, ſpake of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, that his Soul was not left in Hell, neither his Fleſh did ſee Corruption;</hi> and to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> we may add that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>13th.</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> from the <hi>34th.</hi> to the <hi>37th. verſes. And as concerning that he raiſed him up from the dead, now no more to return to Corruption, he ſaid on this wiſe, I will give you the ſure mercies of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>wherefore he ſaith alſo in another Pſalm, Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thy Holy one to ſee Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; for</hi> David, <hi>after he had ſerved his own Generation by the will of God, fell on ſleep and was laid unto his Fathers and ſaw Corruption: But he whom God raiſed up ſaw no Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which places compared with the words of our Saviour himſelf, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is clear, <hi>David,</hi> as his words are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly applied by two of the Apoſtles, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> introduces Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to God the Father in ſuch terms, as do manifeſtly aſcribe the miracle of the Reſurrection to his Power; but our Saviour he aſcribes the ſame miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous event to himſelf, <hi>destroy this Temple,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102592:112"/> and in three days</hi> I <hi>will raiſe it up,</hi> the reſult of which two places compared together, is unavoidably this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>God the Father</hi> are the ſame, the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, although they be divided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in Perſon.</p>
               <p>Further yet, <hi>Jonas</hi> his being three days and three nights in the Whales Belly, was Typical of Jeſus lying for the ſame ſpace of time in the Grave, by the application of our Saviour himſelf; for ſo he tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. at the <hi>39th.</hi> and <hi>40th. verſes, An evil and adulterous Generation ſeeketh after a ſign, and there ſhall be no ſign given it, but the ſign of the Prophet</hi> Jonas, <hi>for as</hi> Jonas <hi>was three days and three nights in the Whales Belly, ſo ſhall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the Heart of the Earth,</hi> and if the <hi>ſwallowing up</hi> of <hi>Jonas</hi> was <hi>Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> of the <hi>burial</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance</hi> of the one under that Calamity, <hi>Typical</hi> of the <hi>continuance</hi> of the other, then certainly the <hi>eſcape</hi> of <hi>Jonas</hi> after <hi>three days,</hi> was likewiſe <hi>Typical</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after the <hi>ſame</hi> ſpace of time, but now <hi>Jonas</hi> his deliverance was wrought by the immediate Power of God, <hi>Jonah, 2d.</hi> and the <hi>10th. And the Lord ſpake unto the Fiſh, and it vomited out Jonas upon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102592:113"/> the dry Land,</hi> and therefore though, the Scripture had not expreſly aſſerted it, yet the <hi>Analogy</hi> of <hi>Type,</hi> and <hi>Antitype</hi> would have required, that the Reſurrection of Jeſus ſhould be owing likewiſe, as indeed it was in it ſelf a much more miraculous event, unto the ſame <hi>Divine Power,</hi> but yet our Saviour, as hath been ſhewn, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the ſame event wholly to <hi>himſelf,</hi> therefore <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> are certainly the ſame, and this is my ſecond argument for the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is taken from his <hi>Reſurrection from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>thirdly,</hi> he that made the World, and all things that are therein, he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> made the World and all things that are therein, therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> certainly was God as well as Man.</p>
               <p>That no <hi>Human Power</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> nay, that nothing ſhort of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf could poſſibly <hi>create, contrive, diſpoſe</hi> and <hi>preſerve</hi> the World, will, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, be granted by all, it being utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable that any skill or power, but what is infinite ſhould be able to bring ſo prodigious an effect to paſs, but now that <hi>Chriſt</hi> made the World, is as plainly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as any one thing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102592:113"/> that is in it, ſo the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>God, who at ſundry times and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners ſpake in time past unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the World; who being the brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, and upholding all things by the word of his Power, when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſat down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high;</hi> and again, <hi>Thou Lord, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hast laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thine Hands, they ſhall periſh, but thou remaineſt, and they ſhall all wax old as doth a Garment, and as a Veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed, but thou art the ſame and thy years ſhall not fail;</hi> ſo alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians, By him were all things Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated that are in Heaven, and that are on Earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be Thrones or Dominions; or Principalities or Powers: all things were Created by him and for him, and he is before all things and by him all things conſist.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> likewiſe tells us, <hi>that the word was made fleſh and dwelt amongſt us,</hi> and <hi>we beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102592:114"/> Truth,</hi> in which nothing can be plainer then that by <hi>the word, Jeſus, the Son of God</hi> is underſtood, who did indeed <hi>take our Fleſh and dwell among us,</hi> he took upon him <hi>the likeneſs of Men,</hi> and put on <hi>the form of a Servant,</hi> and it is of this very <hi>word</hi> that he ſays, <hi>the word was with God and the word was God, and that all things were made by him,</hi> which is my third Argument for the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt, which is drawn from the <hi>Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>fourthly,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> goes further, <hi>all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> from whence the inference is plain, that <hi>he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> was <hi>never made,</hi> for then there would have been ſomething made <hi>without him,</hi> for nothing can make it ſelf, but if he were <hi>unmade</hi> and <hi>uncreated,</hi> it follows of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that he was <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>ſelf-exiſtent</hi> and conſequently <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> does not only tell us, that <hi>he made all things,</hi> and that <hi>without him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> but he ſays likewiſe, <hi>In the beginning was the word;</hi> now this <hi>beginning</hi> cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the beginning of the <hi>Creation,</hi> as it is in the <hi>1ſt. Chapter</hi> of <hi>Geneſis, In the beginning God Created the Heavens and the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102592:114"/> Earth,</hi> for he that made the World, muſt of neceſſity have had his Exiſtence before it, and all being nothing elſe, beyond the Creation, but a great and vaſt Eternity behind it, not divided by any <hi>Periods</hi> or <hi>Epochas</hi> of time, it is manifeſt that this word <hi>beginning,</hi> as it is here uſed, can imply no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the <hi>Eternity</hi> or <hi>ſelf-exiſtence</hi> of him, of whom it is affirmed; for if there was any thing that was <hi>before him,</hi> then it would not be true that he was in the <hi>beginning,</hi> that is, there was no aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, no conceiveable moment of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wherein he did not exiſt; and this is my fifth Argument. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> he that hath <hi>neither beginning of Days nor end of Life,</hi> is <hi>Eternal,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <hi>God;</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> had <hi>neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Days nor end of Life,</hi> therefore he is <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>ſelf-exiſtent,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>God.</hi> They are the words of the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cited, <hi>Melchiſedek being by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation King of Righteouſneſs, and after that alſo King of Peace, without Father, without Mother, having neither beginning of Days nor end of Life, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a Prieſt continually,</hi> he was ſo like him, that he was certainly the ſame,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102592:115"/> for there is but one <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Everlaſting High Priest,</hi> but <hi>one Mediatour betwixt God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who was <hi>King of Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>King of Peace,</hi> in whoſe Diſpenſation and Perſon that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was fulfilled, <hi>Mercy and Truth have met together, Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſſed each other,</hi> at whoſe auſpicious birth the quire of Heaven proclaimed with raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Notes and charming Voices, <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt, on earth peace, good will towards Men,</hi> his <hi>Goſpel</hi> was the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and he was the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and he is ſaid to be like <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> as he is ſaid in another place to have <hi>thought it no robbery to have been equal with God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was indeed the very ſame, beſides that the firſt ingredient in that notion, which we mortals are uſed to entertain of God, is, that he is a <hi>ſelf-originated, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent Being, without beginning of Days or end of Life,</hi> who is the firſt cauſe, the firſt principle and mover, upon which all other things, whether in Heaven or on Earth, have a neceſſary dependance, as upon their primitive Sourſe and Fountain, and we are as ſure that there can be but one ſuch being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that there can be but one
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102592:115"/> God, and that there is none beſides him. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seavently,</hi> My ſeventh Argument ſhall be taken from thoſe words of our Saviour in St. <hi>John, No man hath aſcended up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that came down from Heaven, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Son of Man which is in Heaven;</hi> now it is clear, that in one ſenſe our Saviour had not yet <hi>aſcended up to Heaven;</hi> nor was he like to do it till after his Reſurrection, till when his Body and his Human Nature were to be confined to the Earth, and it is further clear that in this very Senſe <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> had <hi>aſcended</hi> in his <hi>Fiery Chariot</hi> before him, and ſo had <hi>Enoch</hi> too before him; wherefore we muſt refer this Saying to the <hi>ubiquitarineſs</hi> and <hi>omnipreſence</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> by which he was in Heaven and Earth at the ſame time, and was alike preſent to all places at once, <hi>no man hath aſcended up into heaven but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man, which is in Heaven;</hi> or elſe we muſt underſtand the Word <hi>Heaven</hi> of God, as the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Writings do frequently underſtand it, and to this Senſe it is uſed in ſeveral Places of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> and in one of the <hi>Old;</hi> and ſo the Senſe will be this, <hi>no Man hath aſcended up to God,</hi> that is no man
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102592:116"/> enjoys a perfect and entire Commerce and Correſpondence with him; <hi>but he that came down from God, even the Son of Man which is in God,</hi> as our Saviour ſays expreſly of himſelf elſewhere, that <hi>he is in the Father and the Father in him;</hi> and by this way of <hi>Interpretation,</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Human Nature</hi> in the Perſon of Chriſt will be very fitly and aptly repreſented, but otherwiſe than by one of theſe two <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,</hi> I do not ſee what Senſe can be made of the Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> and <hi>lastly,</hi> For I ſhall mention no more, though there be a Cloud of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witneſſes, which have been already ſummoned by other learned Men, to give their <hi>Evidence</hi> to this mighty <hi>Truth;</hi> the <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Co-eſſentiality</hi> of the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with that of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father;</hi> I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the ſame thing from the <hi>nature</hi> of that <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which he performed for us upon the <hi>Croſs;</hi> for it is certain, that all the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Sacrifices</hi> did point at this great and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Propitiation,</hi> which was in the fulneſs of time to be made; and therefore he is called <hi>Christ our Paſs-over;</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expreſly makes the <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>Treſpaſs-Offering</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> to have been Typical of the Sufferings of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102592:116"/> Chriſt upon the Croſs; it is certain like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that thoſe <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be of an <hi>expiatory Nature,</hi> by the Prieſt or the Owners laying his hand upon them, as it were to transfer the guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, and by the <hi>Blouds</hi> being forbidden to be eaten among the <hi>Jews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had contracted a <hi>Levitical</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs by the guilt of the offending Parties; as alſo by the Sin and the <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs-Offerings,</hi> being burnt in many caſes <hi>without the camp,</hi> becauſe of it's Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as Chriſt ſuffered <hi>without the Gate:</hi> For the ſame reaſon, if we will believe the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that by this he might anſwer the <hi>Sin-Offering</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Laſtly, it is certain, that this <hi>Expiation</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Sacrifices,</hi> whatever Opinion the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves might have of it, was not <hi>real</hi> but <hi>typical,</hi> and pointed at that <hi>great Sacrifice;</hi> which was indeed, and in truth, to expiate for the Sins of the whole world. For, <hi>it was not poſſible that the bloud of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away Sins;</hi> as the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us; and for the ſame reaſon it was as little poſſible, that the blood of <hi>one man</hi> ſhould be able to atone and expiate for the ſins of <hi>another,</hi> and much leſs for thoſe of <hi>all mankind,</hi> ſo that it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102592:117"/> was utterly impoſſible, that any thing but the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>God himſelf</hi> ſhould be able to work ſo great, ſo univerſal, and ſo laſting an Atonement, which is all that I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer at preſent as to the ſecond branch of the Text; which concerns the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> only from what hath been ſaid, there are ſome practical Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be made, which I will but name.</p>
               <p>From his being born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> we are in a Figure acquainted with the purity and cleanneſs of his Perſon and his Doctrine, and with that Chaſtity and Innocence, which is expected from us, if we pretend to be his Followers and Diſciples, and from the <hi>Divinity</hi> of his <hi>Perſon</hi> there is a twofold Leſſon, which we are to learn.</p>

               <hi>SECT. 1.</hi> Of the Nature of GOD, together with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of His EXISTENCE.</head>
            <p>I Affirm in the general of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> That it is an <hi>infinite Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Space</hi> endued with all poſſible Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodneſs and Power, and I will prove each of theſe as diſtinctly as I can by themſelves; For it is very hard to keep them from interfereing with one another; <hi>Firſt,</hi> that God is an <hi>infinite Extention, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that he is an <hi>Extention</hi> furniſhed with thoſe attributes which I have aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in their utmoſt <hi>latitude, perfection</hi> and <hi>extent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Extention</hi> of the <hi>Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> I am ſo verily perſwaded of its truth and of its abſolute neceſſity, to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the main <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>natural,</hi> and by conſequence, of all <hi>revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:102592:120"/> that I am, and have always been gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon every occaſion, to inculcate and repeat ſo neceſſary a <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the Foundation of <hi>natural Religion,</hi> becauſe <hi>Extention</hi> belongs to the very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> conſidered in the general; for nothing <hi>is,</hi> which is not <hi>ſomewhere,</hi> and there is no <hi>ſomewhere</hi> which is not <hi>extended;</hi> and indeed, if we conſider the <hi>Divine Omnipreſence,</hi> which is granted by all, though there are ſome that treat of it after ſuch a manner, as if they did not believe it, how is it poſſible for any <hi>Subſtance,</hi> whether <hi>finite</hi> or <hi>infinite,</hi> to be preſent at this place, and preſent at that, truly and properly preſent at both places at the ſame time, and yet not be preſent to all the ſpace between them, and if he be preſent not only to the extremes, but to the intermediate ſpace, then is he manifeſtly <hi>co-extended</hi> to that whole ſpace together; from whence it follows plainly, that there can be no <hi>notion</hi> of the <hi>Divine Omnipreſence,</hi> without ſuppoſing him to be <hi>infinitely extended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, it is manifeſt, that <hi>motion</hi> is a diſtinct thing from <hi>matter,</hi> all <hi>matter</hi> being indifferent in it ſelf, either to <hi>reſt</hi> or <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> neither is there any part of <hi>matter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102592:120"/> at <hi>perfect reſt,</hi> which may not by a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient force, be put into a ſwift degree of <hi>motion,</hi> nor any part of it never ſo ſwiftly moved, which meeting with <hi>obſtacles</hi> and <hi>impediments</hi> from without, may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>perfect reſt,</hi> ſo that it is plain ſince <hi>motion</hi> is not <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>matter;</hi> it muſt therefore either be a thing <hi>ſubſiſting</hi> by it ſelf, or it muſt be the <hi>attribute</hi> or <hi>property</hi> of ſome other <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be the former, a thing ſubſiſting by it ſelf, becauſe <hi>motion</hi> in the <hi>abſtract</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be conceived, for there can be <hi>no motion,</hi> but there muſt at the ſame time be <hi>ſome ſubſtance</hi> or <hi>other</hi> that is moved, or that moves and actuates it ſelf and other things about it, wherefore ſince it hath been proved ſo plainly, that <hi>motion</hi> is not of the <hi>eſſence</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> which cannot move it ſelf, nor encreaſe or ſuſpend its own <hi>motion,</hi> and which from the ſwifteſt <hi>motion,</hi> may by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural impediments</hi> be reduced to <hi>perfect reſt,</hi> it is plain that it muſt unavoidably belong to ſomething which is not <hi>matter,</hi> that is, to an <hi>immaterial</hi> or <hi>incorporeal Subſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore <hi>motion</hi> it ſelf be extended, as it is plain it is in any <hi>fluid body,</hi> whether of <hi>Air,</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Fire,</hi> the force and activity, which moves it and keeps it in a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102592:121"/> ſtate of fluidity, being <hi>Co-extended</hi> to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> it ſelf; then is it neceſſary alſo, that that Principle upon which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and in which it is inhaerent, ſhould be extended in like manner, and to ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, is to ſay, that accidents may wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from their ſubſtance, and they may be ſeparated from one another, which all Men know to be impoſſible and abſurd; for as there can be <hi>no colour</hi> without <hi>ſome ſubſtance</hi> which is <hi>coloured;</hi> no <hi>ſhape</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> without <hi>ſome ſubſtance</hi> which is <hi>figured</hi> and <hi>ſhapen,</hi> ſo neither can there be <hi>any motion</hi> without <hi>ſome ſubſtance</hi> which does <hi>move</hi> or is <hi>moved;</hi> and if there can be no <hi>extenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>colour</hi> or of <hi>figure,</hi> then certainly there can be no <hi>extention</hi> of <hi>motion</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the <hi>extention</hi> of that <hi>ſubſtance</hi> to which it belongs.</p>
            <p>From hence it follows, that that <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>activity,</hi> by which the far greateſt part of the Univerſe is kept in a fluid conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, orin a ſtate of perpetual <hi>motion,</hi> whoſe parts would otherwiſe cling together, as the parts of the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> and other <hi>Planetary bodies</hi> do; I ſay, from hence it follows that this <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>activity</hi> muſt be <hi>coextended</hi> to ſome <hi>immaterial ſubſtance,</hi> wherein this <hi>power</hi> or <hi>activity</hi> ſhall reſide, as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102592:121"/> in its proper ſubject, its efficient cauſe, its original root and fountain and ſpring, and that <hi>ſubſtance</hi> can be no other then God himſelf, or at leaſt it will ultimately termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in him, becauſe all <hi>ſecundary, Created Beings</hi> can have no activity or principle of <hi>ſelf motion,</hi> but what they borrow from the firſt, which is the ſourſe and original of all the reſt, together with their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive faculties and powers.</p>
            <p>Again, this ſelf-active, this ſelf-moving Principle, this firſt Cauſe and Principle of motion in the World, muſt not only be ſuppoſed to be endowed with a Power of Motion and activity from it ſelf, but with a Power of ſuſpending, encreaſing, or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly withdrawing this activity, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelf; for otherwiſe if it did always act to the utmoſt of it's Power, ſince the matter is every where in it's own Nature, any otherwiſe than as it is awakened and ſtirred up by this Principle from without, equally ſluggiſh, immoveable and unactive, and ſince <hi>this being</hi> is uniform and like it ſelf throughout, equally ſelf-moving, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and ſelf-active, it would follow from theſe two things conſidered together, that all the parts of the <hi>Creation</hi> ſhould be moved with equal ſwiftneſs, that the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102592:122"/> 
               <hi>Earth</hi> ſhould be diſſolved and ſhattered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fine and ſubtle conſiſtence of the pureſt <hi>aether,</hi> and that all the <hi>Matter</hi> in the <hi>World</hi> ſhould be not only fluid, but ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal too, which is contrary to <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> wherefore that all things are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with equal ſwiftneſs, that all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> conſiſts, is not crumbled into the fineſt Air and the moſt ſubtle <hi>aether;</hi> it can be referred to nothing but this, that that <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>

                  </gap>ciple</hi> in which the Power of ſelf-activity and ſelf-motion reſides, can either ſuſpend, decreaſe, or utterly withdraw that motion as it pleaſes it ſelf; and this is confirmed by our own daily Experience of our ſelves, who being a lower ſort of immaterial Beings, are likewiſe in our <hi>Proportion</hi> endued with a Power of <hi>ſelf-activity</hi> and <hi>ſelf-motion</hi> from within, which, though as being the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a finite and imperfect agent, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be extended beyond ſuch a ſphere of activity, yet within that ſphere or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or degree, it may either ſuſpend or encreaſe, or utterly remove and withdraw its activity as it pleaſes it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> ſince this being is not only fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with an ability to act or move, but with a power of proportioning that activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102592:122" rendition="simple:additions"/> and that motion, according to its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſince it appears farther by our daily and perpetual experience of all the objects about us, by the <hi>earth which he hath made,</hi> and by <hi>the Heavens which are the work of his hands,</hi> by the admirable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and artifice of all things conſidered by themſelves, by their agreement and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with one another, for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>whole,</hi> and by the fitneſs of the <hi>whole Fabrick,</hi> and the ſeeming conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of its <hi>ſeveral parts,</hi> for the ſubſiſtence and happineſs of thoſe Creatures that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſenſitive and the reaſonable world, I ſay, ſince it appears by all this, that the <hi>activity</hi> or <hi>ſelf-motion</hi> of the <hi>Divine Substance,</hi> is tempered by meaſures of the moſt obliging <hi>goodneſs,</hi> the moſt exact <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the moſt profound <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and yet that all the ſeveral inſtances compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, are at the ſame time an irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument of a moſt unbounded and uncontroulable power, this makes up in ſhort the perfect and compleat demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I undertook to prove, that God is nothing elſe but an <hi>infinite extenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>omnipreſent Substance,</hi> endued with all poſſible <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>power.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>DES Cartez</hi> diſtinguiſhes very right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwixt <hi>cogitation</hi> or <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>extention,</hi> for they are two things, and therefore the <hi>notion</hi> of the <hi>latter</hi> does not of neceſſity include in it, that of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> there may be an extended <hi>ſubſtance</hi> which does not, which cannot <hi>think,</hi> but yet for all that there can be no <hi>thinking ſubstance</hi> but what is <hi>extended,</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>extention</hi> is the common attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of all <hi>ſubſtance</hi> whatſoever, and if the very <hi>eſſence</hi> and <hi>being</hi> of an <hi>immaterial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> do depend wholly and entirely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>cogitation,</hi> and upon nothing elſe, I would willingly demand of the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> whether we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this of <hi>actual,</hi> or only of <hi>potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> or <hi>poſſible</hi> cogitation?</p>
            <p>If the former, if nothing but <hi>actual</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102592:123"/> will ſerve the turn, then the Soul in a ſleep or trance, or what we are uſed to call a <hi>brown ſtudy,</hi> ceaſing to think, muſt alſo ceaſe to be, for there can be no <hi>cogitation</hi> without <hi>ſelf conſciouſneſs</hi> or a <hi>ſenſe of thinking,</hi> and when it begins to think again, it muſt be ſuppoſed to be <hi>Created a new,</hi> or rather every <hi>distinct cogitation,</hi> every <hi>particular thought</hi> that comes into our heads muſt be a <hi>diſtinct Soul,</hi> which things are ſo abſurd, that nothing can be more.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102592:124"/> it ſelf, of <hi>exerting</hi> or <hi>ſuſpending</hi> a certain degree of <hi>activity</hi> as it pleaſes, muſt needs, be <hi>diſtinct</hi> from that <hi>power</hi> which may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>exerted</hi> or <hi>ſuſpended,</hi> or indeed, while the Soul continues <hi>united</hi> to this earthly <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> cannot always be equally exerted in our ſelves, beſides the difference of tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſtitution, which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our ſelves and others, though the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> in which this activity reſides be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the <hi>ſame</hi> in us, and always <hi>ſpecifically</hi> the <hi>ſame,</hi> that is, a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of exactly the <hi>ſame nature</hi> in <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Des Cartez</hi> is the leſs to be credited, in ſetting <hi>cogitation</hi> and <hi>extention</hi> at ſo wide a <hi>diſtance</hi> from one another, becauſe it is plain he did it to <hi>ſerve</hi> a <hi>turn,</hi> for in that <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical World</hi> which is of his contriving, he hath ordered the matter ſo, as to divide the whole <hi>univerſe</hi> into certain <hi>Vortices</hi> or <hi>Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools,</hi> in the <hi>centre</hi> of one of which is the <hi>Sun,</hi> round about which the <hi>Earth</hi> is <hi>moved</hi> by the <hi>ſubtle matter</hi> of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> much after the ſame manner as you ſhall ſee a <hi>ſtraw</hi> turn round in a <hi>Whirl-pool</hi> of the <hi>water,</hi> when by reaſon of too ſtrait a <hi>paſſage,</hi> and too ſwift a <hi>motion,</hi> the <hi>water</hi> cannot paſs freely on in a direct courſe, but is <hi>obſtructed</hi> by it ſelf, and is <hi>reflected</hi> back with an <hi>eddy</hi> towards the <hi>Fountain.</hi>

            <p>For all <hi>natural motion</hi> is in a ſtrait line, as is evident by this, that where there is no ſuch obſtruction, there the water flows ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily in a direct <hi>Channel,</hi> without any ſuch violent returns upon it ſelf: thus ſmoak aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends directly, when its motion is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by the wind, and heavy bodies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend in a perpendicular line, and the ſame is likewiſe further confirmed by <hi>Dez Cartez</hi> himſelf, by the experiment of a <hi>Sling,</hi> which the faſter it is ſwung about in a circular <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the more ſtrait and tite is the ſtring or thong of it kept by the ſtone which is at the <hi>bottom,</hi> which <hi>reſiſts</hi> and <hi>oppoſes</hi> the <hi>circular motion,</hi> which is <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>unnatural</hi> to it, and endeavours all the while to fly off and be gone in a ſtrait or direct line, beſides that <hi>motion</hi> in a right line, is the moſt ſimple and eaſie ſort of <hi>motion,</hi> whereas there is no ſuch thing in nature, as an <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Circle,</hi> but it conſiſts in effect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſo many little ſtraight Lines, paſſing out of <hi>one</hi> into <hi>another,</hi> that is, of ſo many ſeveral violences and interruptions done to the direct and rectilinear <hi>motion.</hi>

            <p>Since therefore <hi>Des Cartez</hi> had divided the whole Univerſe into ſo many great <hi>Vortices</hi> or <hi>Whirl pools,</hi> one of which is that which we inhabit, the <hi>Center</hi> of which is the <hi>Sun,</hi> as all the fixt <hi>Stars</hi> that we ſee

            <p>And Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> ſetting aſide his known <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is the rather to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, becauſe he does not ſay this meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerve a turn, as <hi>Des Cartes</hi> manifeſtly did; for if <hi>extenſion</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the ſame, then there may be an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But if <hi>Des Cartez</hi> had conſidered as he ought to have done, that <hi>motion</hi> is not a <hi>thing</hi> or <hi>Creature ſubſiſting</hi> by it ſelf, as he ſeems to make it, when he tells us that <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>beginning</hi> of <hi>things Created</hi> ſuch a quantity of <hi>motion,</hi> which hath been ever ſince preſerved, there being no ſuch thing to be conceived as motion <hi>in abſtracto</hi> or <hi>motion</hi> without ſome <hi>principle</hi> that moves it ſelf and communicates that <hi>motion</hi> to the <hi>matter,</hi> which hath no <hi>ſelf-activity</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in its nature, he would then eaſily have diſcerned, that this <hi>power</hi> or <hi>activity</hi> being ſo largely diffuſed, and ſo widely ſpread abroad, as we ſee it is, the cauſe in which it reſides, muſt of neceſſity be ſo too.</p>
            <p>He might alſo have known, if it had been for the intereſt of his beloved <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to do it, that where all things are ſo cram'd that nothing can yield or give
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102592:127"/> place, it was impoſſible there ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>motion,</hi> and therefore, that the bare granting of ſuch a thing as <hi>motion,</hi> as well with reſpect to thoſe <hi>bodies</hi> upon which it <hi>acts,</hi> as of that <hi>ſubſtance</hi> in which it <hi>reſides,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Energy</hi> it is, does unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably prove a <hi>ſpace</hi> or <hi>extention,</hi> which is not matter.</p>
            <p>And this is ſo true and ſo very plain, that though this interſperſed vacuity, as well as the <hi>ultra mandane</hi> ſpaces, may ſeem very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the <hi>conſtruction</hi> of a <hi>vortex,</hi> yet the <hi>old Epicureans,</hi> who had their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> that is, their <hi>Vortices</hi> or <hi>Whirl-pools</hi> too, and from them it is moſt likely that <hi>Des Cartez</hi> received his, yet were forced to admit of ſuch an immaterial ſpace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they thought, and they thought very rightly, no <hi>motion</hi> could be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and as he received his <hi>vortices</hi> from <hi>Epicurus,</hi> ſo whether his <hi>Cometology,</hi> the <hi>abſorption</hi> of his <hi>Stars,</hi> and the <hi>Formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his <hi>Planets</hi> were not a part of the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of the <hi>antient World</hi> may be a queſtion, which deſerves to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For ſome ſuch thing ſeems to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to in that <hi>Expreſſion</hi> of St. <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 13. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>BUt I am firmly of opinion, whatever the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> are pleaſed to ſay, who whether they be more conceited of themſelves, or of their Maſter <hi>Des Cartez</hi> is hard to determine, that <hi>Des Cartez</hi> was as rank an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and a far more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous one: than either <hi>Diagoras</hi> or <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> or any of thoſe whom <hi>Antiquity</hi> hath branded with that Name, and that he had a <hi>Deſign</hi> of introducing <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and a <hi>Belief</hi> of nothing, but <hi>Body,</hi> into the World.</p>
            <p>For though indeed he does very rightly affirm the <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>extenſion</hi> and <hi>cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be, as they are, very different from
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102592:128"/> one another, yet when he makes <hi>extenſion</hi> to be the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>conſtitutive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> and takes upon him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert not only, that all <hi>matter</hi> is <hi>extended,</hi> but alſo that nothing is <hi>extended</hi> but what is <hi>matter,</hi> the conſequence of this is, when I come afterwards to conſider, that I can have no <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Subſtance</hi> without <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and I have already granted <hi>extenſion</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> to be the ſame, that <hi>cogitation</hi> ſhall be only a certain <hi>mode</hi> or <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the infinitely diverſifyed, and variouſly complicated <hi>Parts</hi> of this <hi>extenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, his rejecting thoſe arguments for the <hi>existence</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> which have been uſed all along to be taken from the <hi>Fabrick</hi> and contrivance of the <hi>World,</hi> as indeed it was neceſſary for him to do, who had contrived ſuch a <hi>giddy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> of his own, and ſubſtituting in the ſtead of it, that <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſh</hi> of an <hi>Idea,</hi> unable to withſtand the leaſt puff of <hi>diſputation</hi> (which inſtead of defending the <hi>existence</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to betray the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>) does but too plainly diſcover what thoughts we are to entertain of him, by whom ſo fallacious and inconcluſive an argument was <hi>ſubſtituted</hi> in the ſtead of that, which is ſo ſtrong in it ſelf, and hath
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102592:129"/> been ſo ſucceſsful in all ages, to preſerve the <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> of a <hi>God</hi> among <hi>Men.</hi> To be ſure <hi>David</hi> and this <hi>Philoſopher</hi> were not of a mind, for he tells us very honeſtly, for want of this <hi>new Philoſophy</hi> wherewith after <hi>ages</hi> have been <hi>bleſſed, The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy work, day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledge, there is no ſpeech nor language where their voice is not heard; Their line is gone out through all the Earth, and their words to the end of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may ſee the better how weak and inconcluſive his <hi>argument</hi> drawn from the <hi>Idea</hi> is, I will explain as clearly as I can, what it is that he underſtands by it, he tells us therefore what is very true, that we are all of us born <hi>Infants,</hi> and that we come into the <hi>world</hi> without any <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> or <hi>experience</hi> of the <hi>things</hi> about us, from whence it ſo falls out, that in ſome things we paſs a wrong <hi>Judgment</hi> our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and in others we are deceived by taking things upon truſt, from thoſe that are <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves mistaken,</hi> that having once embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced an <hi>errour</hi> and eſpouſed it for a long time, it is very hard, as indeed it is for us to <hi>undeceive</hi> our <hi>ſelves,</hi> or to believe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102592:129"/> of it, then as of a moſt <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>undoubted truth,</hi> he ſaith, that our <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> do in many things delude us, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us, as a <hi>ſtick</hi> in the <hi>water</hi> ſhall appear <hi>crooked,</hi> tho' it be indeed <hi>ſtraight,</hi> and a ſquare <hi>Tower</hi> or <hi>Building</hi> ſhall at a diſtance have the appearance of <hi>round,</hi> and a <hi>Marble</hi> touch'd by two <hi>fingers</hi> croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one another ſhall affect one with a <hi>Senſe,</hi> as if it were two, though it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but one, he tells us that in our dreams things do appear to us to be as real, as when we are never ſo wide awake, and that there is no certain way to diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>realities</hi> of the <hi>day,</hi> and the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions</hi> of the <hi>night,</hi> ſince the <hi>one</hi> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appear as <hi>real</hi> as the <hi>other,</hi> and at that time when they <hi>strike</hi> our <hi>Imagination,</hi> we do as really believe them to be true, <hi>there are many,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that argue from a falſe Principle, and then it is impoſſible, but all the Concluſions, that are built upon it, muſt either be falſe or uncertain, there are others that let their</hi> Principle <hi>be never ſo right, yet they do not argue rightly from it, and on both ſides it happens that thoſe things are taken for certain Demonstrations, which are indeed nothing better, than very foul and palpable</hi> Miſtakes; and upon ſuch conſiderations
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102592:130"/> as theſe he exhorts his <hi>Diſciple,</hi> as the beſt way to diſcover the Truth, <hi>to doubt of all things, the truth of his Faculties, the evidence of his Senſes, the certainty even of direct and Mathematical Demonſtrations; but yet at the ſame time,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is impoſſible, I ſhould believe otherwiſe, but that I that</hi> doubt <hi>muſt</hi> be; <hi>For I can never give my Aſſent to this</hi> Propoſition, <hi>That</hi> that which is not can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt or think; <hi>therefore he lays down this as the first propoſition of which we can be certain;</hi> I doubt therefore I am, or I think therefore I am, <hi>that is,</hi> I <hi>am as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of the Exiſtence of my body, which being only an Object of my Senſes,</hi> I <hi>may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it, as well as in any other ſenſible Object whatſoever, but yet ſtill notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is moſt certainly true;</hi> I doubt therefore I am, <hi>that is, that</hi> thing <hi>or</hi> nature <hi>whatever it is, which</hi> doubts <hi>or</hi> thinks <hi>or</hi> diſputes <hi>with it ſelf about all other things, muſt of neceſſity, have a real and undoubted Exiſtence of its own, and though</hi> I <hi>be deceived in all the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which</hi> I <hi>make upon the things about me, or that appear to me, as if they had a Being, yet thus much is ſtill unqueſtionably true,</hi> I am deceived therefore I am; <hi>for that which is not cannot be deceived.</hi>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102592:131"/> the moſt unqueſtionable Demonſtration could make them, but at laſt after a great deal of Rummaging and Tumbling over the</hi> Ideas <hi>of his mind, he finds one</hi> Idea <hi>or</hi> Notion <hi>of a</hi> Being <hi>neceſſarily existent, and this he tells us cannot chuſe but be; becauſe it hath neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Exiſtence included in it's Nature, and this is that which he calls God.</hi>

            <p>I Have laid down in the former <hi>Section,</hi> as plain and candid a <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> as I am able to make, of that famous <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the <hi>Existence</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> which is drawn from the <hi>Idaea,</hi> or from the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>God</hi> implanted in the minds of <hi>Men,</hi>

            <p>But againſt this profound way of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,</hi> that hath drawn ſo many eminent <hi>Diſciples</hi> after it, there are theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Objections</hi> to be made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> that if we would go the <hi>Carteſian</hi> way to work, yet this Propoſition, <hi>I think therefore I am,</hi> cannot poſſibly be the <hi>firſt Propoſition,</hi> of which I muſt be certain, but there muſt of neceſſity be three other <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> of whoſe <hi>Truth</hi> I muſt be well aſſured before I can be certain of this, and theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> are evidently theſe,</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſe a Man to be never ſo ſure of his own <hi>exiſtence,</hi> yet in this <hi>ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical way</hi> of <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> when I am once at a doubt of the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of all other things, beſides my ſelf; it is utterly impoſſible, that ever I ſhould get rid of this ſcruple by any means whatſoever; for though I do find the <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Being</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>exiſtent,</hi> impreſſed upon my mind; yet if I underſtand this of any thing without, and beſides, my ſelf, how can I tell, but I may be deceived in this <hi>Idaea,</hi> as well as in any other. It is true indeed there muſt be ſomewhat neceſſarily <hi>exiſtent,</hi> or elſe nothing could be; for <hi>out of nothing comes nothing,</hi> but how can I tell, but I my ſelf am that ſelf-originated, that ſelf-exiſtent <hi>Being:</hi> For, becauſe I cannot look back for any long ſpace of time, it does by no means follow from thence, that there was any time when I was not; for I may poſſibly have forgot my ſelf, as thoſe that

            </p>
            <p>If this <hi>Philoſophy</hi> were true, <hi>Men</hi> might e'en ſhut up their <hi>Shops,</hi> and ſow up their <hi>Mouths,</hi> and trouble themſelves no farther about the things of <hi>this Life;</hi> for why ſhould any <hi>Man</hi> concern himſelf about things that <hi>are not,</hi> but only <hi>ſeem</hi> to be, and when it is utterly impoſſible for him to get rid of his doubts, I can hardly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102592:134"/> how it is poſſible for ſuch a <hi>Man</hi> to act with that <hi>ſteadineſs</hi> and <hi>gravity,</hi> and <hi>conſtant purpoſe</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> as if he were well ſatisfied in the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>ſenſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed, that it does by no means become a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> to take things upon <hi>trust,</hi> without examining into their <hi>truth</hi> himſelf; but yet to doubt of all things, is notwithſtanding every whit as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical</hi> as to <hi>examine</hi> into nothing; for a <hi>Philiſopher,</hi> if he be any thing at all, is a <hi>Man</hi> that pretends to know ſomewhat more then his <hi>Neighbours,</hi> but at this rate of <hi>Philoſophiſing</hi> he will know leſs, or at leaſt it will be impoſſible that they ſhould know leſs then he, for no man can know leſs than nothing; and this is the higheſt pitch to which a <hi>Carteſian Philoſopher</hi> can attain.</p>
            <p>But <hi>thirdly,</hi> I affirm that we have no <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a being <hi>neceſſarily exiſtent,</hi> imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon us by <hi>Nature,</hi> but it is only the effect of our reaſoning with our <hi>ſelves</hi> and with <hi>one another,</hi> we find our ſelves by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to be <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>imperfect Creatures,</hi> we are ſenſible that we come into the world, not by any <hi>power</hi> or <hi>vertue</hi> of our own, and that this was the caſe of our Parents before us, and of theirs before them, we

            <p>Neither indeed were there ever any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Des Cartez,</hi> who did aſſert any ſuch innate <hi>Idaeas</hi> or inbred <hi>Notions,</hi> implanted upon the minds of <hi>Men,</hi> antecedently to their converſe with the <hi>objects</hi> that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and the reaſoning which they make within themſelves, by comparing and collating things with one another, but the <hi>antient Platoniſts,</hi> and thoſe that have received it from them, Men of a <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> far different from <hi>Des Cartez</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> who did it upon this account, that they ſuppoſed us to have lived in times paſt, in a <hi>Superiour State,</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>immortal Spirits,</hi> cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all about with bodies of an <hi>Aethereal</hi> and <hi>Heavenly contexture,</hi> but that for our <hi>Tranſgreſſions</hi> in that <hi>bleſſed State,</hi> we were caſt down from thence by the juſt <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>God</hi> into this loweſt <hi>Region</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which is the very ſink and ſediment of <hi>nature,</hi> which was not only intended as a puniſhment, but as an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> to make a new experiment upon us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we would reform our ſelves, and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained a perfect <hi>Conqueſt</hi> over our <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>paſſions,</hi> return again into that <hi>bleſſed place,</hi> from whence, by our <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>enormities</hi> we had departed, and from

            <p>But not to concern our ſelves about this Doctrine of <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> a Doctrine which hath exerciſed the <hi>Wits</hi> and <hi>Pens</hi> of ſo many <hi>learned Men;</hi> It is plain that this <hi>Platonick</hi> fancy of <hi>innate</hi> or <hi>inbred notions,</hi> ought by no means to find entertainment in the <hi>Creed</hi> of <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>underſtanding Men,</hi> not only becauſe it is precarious, but alſo becauſe it is needleſs; for it may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhewn, by a particular induction,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102592:136"/> that there is no <hi>notion</hi> which the mind of Man is capable of receiving, which he may not derive from the information of his ſenſes, by converſing with <hi>external objects,</hi> by comparing them together, and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or denying them, (according to the congruities or diſagreements, which by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience we find in them) of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>By converſing with objects ſingly and by themſelves, there ariſe ſo many ſeveral <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Idaeas</hi> or <hi>Pictures</hi> drawn and painted upon our <hi>Imagination,</hi> by affirming or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them one of another, we frame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and by tying ſeveral of theſe propoſitions, by thoſe natural connexions which we find in them together, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth that which we call <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> or <hi>ratiocination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you ask how by the <hi>mediation</hi> of our <hi>Senſes</hi> we come to have any <hi>Knowledg</hi> of an <hi>immaterial Nature,</hi> that is of an <hi>Object</hi> which neither does nor can affect our <hi>Senſes,</hi> to this I anſwer, that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving converſed with ſeveral <hi>ſenſible Objects</hi> and compared them together, having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated thoſe things, which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> have ſeparated from one another, and joyned thoſe things and notions which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102592:137"/> ought to be put together, it is then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for us to begin to enquire, what it is that makes this <hi>reflexion</hi> upon the things without us, that diſputes and argues <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> within it ſelf upon the <hi>Objects,</hi> that come within it's <hi>Obſervation;</hi> and this, it is eaſie to perceive, that it cannot be meer matter, which is a dull, ſtupid and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, without any Life, Activity, or Power; but it needs muſt be ſomething which is not <hi>matter,</hi> of whoſe <hi>nature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is difficult for us to have ſo clear a <hi>Perception</hi> from the <hi>Information</hi> of our <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which cannot immediately convey any thing but <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>material things;</hi> therefore we expreſs it by a <hi>negative Term,</hi> and call it an <hi>immaterial Being,</hi> which does not tell us <hi>poſitively</hi> what <hi>it is,</hi> but only <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively</hi> what <hi>it is not,</hi> and yet becauſe we have a <hi>poſitive</hi> notion of <hi>cogitation,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot reflect upon any thing whatſoever, nor have any the leaſt <hi>Senſe</hi> of any the moſt common <hi>Object,</hi> that falls under our view and apprehenſion; therefore to the <hi>negative</hi> conception of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material,</hi> we add the <hi>poſitive</hi> of <hi>cogitant,</hi> and becauſe we cannot poſſibly conceive any <hi>ſubſtance</hi> whatſoever, which is not <hi>ſomewhere,</hi> and by conſequence which is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102592:137"/> not <hi>extended;</hi> therefore this makes up the <hi>compleat Idea,</hi> which we have of our own <hi>minds</hi> or <hi>ſouls,</hi> that they are <hi>immaterial, cogitant</hi> and <hi>extended</hi> Beings; and becauſe <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>thought</hi> wherever they are found are an <hi>Argument</hi> in other <hi>Substances</hi> of an <hi>immaterial Nature,</hi> as well as they are in <hi>us,</hi> therefore when we ſee the <hi>admirable wiſdom</hi> and <hi>contrivance,</hi> wherewith all things in the <hi>World</hi> without us are mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and diſpoſed; this brings us to a firm and infallible aſſurance, that there is one <hi>great</hi> and <hi>univerſal mind</hi> preſiding over all things, and appointing to all the ſeveral <hi>Parts</hi> of which either the <hi>inanimate,</hi> or the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>animated World</hi> are made up, all their reſpective <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> their <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Employments,</hi> their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Poſts</hi> and <hi>Stations</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, for the better <hi>preſervation</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and for the greater harmony, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſecurity of the whole, and this is that which, without the help of a <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic</hi> or a <hi>Carteſian Idea</hi> imprinted antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to this <hi>ratiocination</hi> upon our minds, we are uſed to call a <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, that ſince it is ſo plain and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that we have no <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> in our minds, which we may not derive
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102592:138"/> from the <hi>information</hi> of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> and if over and above we will needs have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the <hi>Platonic Ideas,</hi> or <hi>inbred No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in the mind of Man, then either theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> do <hi>agree</hi> and <hi>jump</hi> with the <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> or they <hi>do not,</hi> if the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> if they <hi>do not agree,</hi> then either we muſt renounce the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> which we cannot do without making <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck</hi> of Life it ſelf, or of theſe ſuppoſed <hi>Platonical Ideas,</hi> which is much the more ſafe and reaſonable of the two; eſpecially, if we conſider, after all the noiſe that hath been raiſed about them, that we are not conſcious to our ſelves of any ſuch things, and that without them, we can give a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Account of all that <hi>Knowledg</hi> to which <hi>human Nature</hi> is capable of arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>But in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, if theſe two, the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Senſe</hi> do agree and jump with one another, then the <hi>Rule</hi> holds good, <hi>Natura nihil facit fruſtra, Nature does nothing in vain,</hi> if the <hi>Ideas</hi> be ſufficient, what needs the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſenſe, or what ſignifie thoſe <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> which cannot be believed till a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation be given from without, but if the teſtimony of ſenſe be at laſt the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102592:138"/> true <hi>touch-stone</hi> by which we muſt meaſure the truth of our <hi>Ideas,</hi> then how vain and fruitleſs are thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> themſelves? and this I take to be a ſufficient confutation of the <hi>innate Ideas,</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Des Cartez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is ſtill further to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in oppoſition to this trifling <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Des Cartez,</hi> that it is a <hi>meer Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> as the <hi>Logicians</hi> uſe to call it, that is, it is ſuch a ſort of <hi>Sophistical argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> wherein <hi>two</hi> things are proved by <hi>one another,</hi> for if you ask this <hi>great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> as ſome that are <hi>very little ones,</hi> are pleaſed to eſteem him, how he can tell, that there is indeed a <hi>being</hi> neceſſarily <hi>exiſtent,</hi> notwithſtanding that we find ſuch an <hi>Idea</hi> implanted upon our <hi>natures,</hi> in which we may poſſibly be deceived, he tells you that this depends upon the truth of our <hi>intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual faculties,</hi> and if you ask him again, how he can tell that our <hi>intellectual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> are true, he proves this by ſuppoſing a <hi>being</hi> neceſſarily <hi>exiſtent,</hi> which is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch goodneſs, that it would not deceive us, and ſo this is no more then <hi>mulus mulum ſcabit, one good turn requires another,</hi> or it is the ſame thing in diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if in a Court of <hi>Judicature,</hi> you ſhould bring two <hi>Perſons,</hi> whoſe innocence is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102592:139"/> the matter in queſtion, to purge and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate one another by their Teſtimony, which they will be ſure to do for their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantage and ſafety, but are for that reaſon look'd upon in <hi>Law,</hi> as <hi>incompetent Witneſſes,</hi> and ſuch whoſe Teſtimony ought by no means to be taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> we are ſo far from having an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> of God implanted upon our <hi>Natures,</hi> immediately by God himſelf, that in <hi>truth</hi> we have no ſuch <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God</hi> at all, either <hi>one</hi> way or the <hi>other,</hi> it is true, a very ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of reaſon will aſſure us, that there is ſuch a <hi>being</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> but what he is we know not, and we have only <hi>negative Conceptions</hi> of his <hi>nature,</hi> we ſay he is <hi>immaterial,</hi> and he is <hi>infinite,</hi> he is <hi>immortal</hi> and <hi>incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but of theſe things we have no clear and poſitive <hi>conception,</hi> and conſequently nothing that can be properly called an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea.</hi>

            <p>All that is meant by <hi>immateriality,</hi> is, that it includes a <hi>negation</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> and all that is meant by <hi>infinite</hi> is, that it is <hi>not finite,</hi> but for us that are <hi>poor finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> to have a true and <hi>proper notion</hi> of that which is <hi>infinite,</hi> is <hi>impoſſible;</hi> for us that have ſeen ſo ſmall and inconſiderable a proportion of time paſſing by us, for us
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102592:139"/> that in the compaſs of a <hi>few years,</hi> muſt <hi>molder</hi> away and <hi>crumble</hi> into <hi>duſt;</hi> for us to have a true and adequate <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> and <hi>incorruptibility,</hi> is a thing that can never enter into the mind of <hi>Man</hi> to believe; all our <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate and imperfect, we ſay he is a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>infinite Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>infinite Power,</hi> but all that we do truly underſtand by theſe words, is, that he hath all that <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which we have or can diſcern in other <hi>Creatures,</hi> and all that we want, but how much, or what <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that is which we want, we know not, for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe we want it, and becauſe we come infinitely ſhort of it, ſo that after all, it appears plainly from whence we have that <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which we find dwelling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our minds, we receive it from our <hi>ſelves</hi> and from the <hi>objects</hi> about us, by aſcribing to <hi>God</hi> all the perfection which belongs to the <hi>Creatures,</hi> and ſo much more as they want, and by excluding or praeſcinding, as the <hi>Schools</hi> term it, all their <hi>imperfection,</hi> and the caſe is the ſame, as when I ſay ſuch a Man is an excellent <hi>Mathematician,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an excellent <hi>Orator</hi> or <hi>Poet</hi> or <hi>Muſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that is, they have all that skill in theſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102592:140"/> arts which I have, and a great deal more, which I have not, and of which for that reaſon I can have no apprehenſion, which <hi>Idea</hi> is manifeſtly raiſed by my ſelf after a confuſed manner, not imprinted by the <hi>Artiſt</hi> himſelf, upon my mind, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as his works and performances in the ſeveral kinds, give me ſome rude conception and inadequate <hi>Idea</hi> of him, but it is certain, if he himſelf had been to leave his own impreſſion upon me, he would have made it like himſelf, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I ſhould have had the ſame skill in theſe faculties whch he hath attained.</p>
            <p>Juſt ſo it is with <hi>God,</hi> an inadequate <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> or <hi>notion</hi> of him may be formed by our ſelves, from the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> without having recourſe to any <hi>ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impreſſion,</hi> but an adaequate <hi>Idea</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have without being a <hi>God</hi> my ſelf, for no one can have a true and perfect <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>infinite goodneſs, wiſdom</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> but he that is the <hi>poſſeſſor</hi> of them, and he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion can be no leſs then <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> by this it appears how frivolous this <hi>argument</hi> of <hi>Des Cartez</hi> drawn from the <hi>Idea,</hi> is, that after all, according to him, it is but the <hi>Idea</hi> of an <hi>unextended ſubſtance,</hi> that is, in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102592:140"/> nothing, and it appears likewiſe, that <hi>God</hi> never <hi>imprinted</hi> this <hi>Idea</hi> upon any <hi>Mans</hi> mind, for this would be but to deceive and abuſe us, and to make our <hi>intellectual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> which can have no <hi>notion</hi> of any thing, which is not extended, to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his <hi>impreſſions,</hi> and conſequently leave us in a doubt and perplexity, never to be reſolved, what <hi>notion</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain concerning him.</p>
            <p>And thus I have conſidered more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then ever any <hi>Writer</hi> hath hitherto done before me, the manifeſt inconcluſiveneſs of the <hi>Carteſian argument,</hi> drawn from the <hi>Idea,</hi> and that being ſubſtituted in the ſtead of that which was uſed formerly to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the admirable <hi>ſtructure</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> it ſeems rather to have been done with a deſign to introduce <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> then with an <hi>intention</hi> to <hi>ſettle</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> the <hi>belief</hi> of a <hi>Deity</hi> among Men.</p>

            <p>AND now, that I may diſpatch what remains further to be ſpoken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Argument,</hi> I will do theſe <hi>three things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will go on to give ſome other proofs, that <hi>Des Cartez,</hi> who denied this <hi>immaterial Extenſion,</hi> did it indeed, with a deſign to baniſh all <hi>immaterial ſubſtance</hi> out of the <hi>world,</hi> notwithſtanding, that as well he as Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and the <hi>Old Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curcans</hi> are wont to impoſe upon their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> by uſing the Name of <hi>God,</hi> that the <hi>Laws</hi> might not reach them for denying <hi>his Exiſtence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will propoſe ſome further conſiderations, for the proof of this great
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102592:141"/> and fundamental <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>Being infinitely extended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will ſhew the advantage of this way of procedure for the proof of the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and for the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating, as far as <hi>human apprehenſion</hi> can reach, what thoughts we are to entertain concerning his nature.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt, that is, to give ſome other Proofs, that <hi>Des Cartez,</hi> who denied the <hi>Extenſion</hi> of the <hi>Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> did it with a deſign to baniſh all <hi>Immaterial Beings</hi> out of the world.</p>
            <p>And the firſt thing which I ſhall inſtance in, ſhall be his baniſhing of <hi>final Cauſes</hi> out of his <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that is, the <hi>Scripture</hi> does expreſly aſſure us, that the <q>Heavens are the works of <hi>Gods</hi> hands, and that the <hi>Moon</hi> and the <hi>Stars</hi> are of his ordaining;</q> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> cries out, being raviſhed with the contemplation of that <hi>infinite beauty, harmony,</hi> and <hi>contrivance,</hi> which appears in all parts of the ſenſible <hi>Creation, how wonderful are thy works O Lord, in wiſdom haſt thou made them all,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Job</hi> tells us in moſt emphatical terms, That <hi>he looketh to the ends of the Earth, and looketh under the whole Heaven, that he made the weight for the Wind;, and weighed the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102592:142"/> by meaſure, that he made a decree for the Rain, and away for the Lightning of the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he did ſee it and declared it, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated it, yea, and ſearched it out,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>and unto Man he ſaid, behold the fear of the Lord, that is Wiſdom, and to depart from evil that is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, that the <hi>conſideration</hi> of the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>contrivance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> this is the great <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Baſis</hi> of all <hi>Religion,</hi> this is that which alone is able to <hi>create</hi> in us ſuch an <hi>awful</hi> and <hi>Majeſtic notion</hi> of his <hi>wiſdom, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, immenſity</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> as may the moſt effectually provoke, the moſt win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly entice, and the moſt powerfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to fear, to love and to obey him, to obſerve his Commandments and to keep his Laws, and to depart from all ways, which he by the voice of <hi>Nature</hi> or of <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> hath declared to be fooliſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and diſpleaſing to him.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>38th.</hi> and <hi>39th. Chapters</hi> of that excellent Book, it is very remarkable to this purpoſe, to obſerve the queſtions which God propounds to <hi>Job,</hi> in all of which it is implied, that he himſelf and none but he, not any <hi>power</hi> or <hi>wiſdom</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to his own, not any <hi>blind chance</hi> of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102592:142"/> the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> nor any <hi>Mechanical Powers</hi> of matter with <hi>Des Cartez</hi> was the cauſe of that wonderful uſefulneſs and beauty, which appears in the whole <hi>Creation</hi> and in all its parts, and in the advantage and uſe and ſervice which they do mutually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and lend to one another. <hi>Then the Lord anſwered</hi> Job <hi>out of the Whirlwind, and ſaid, who is this that darkneth Council by words, without knowledge?</hi> that is, as it appears by what follows, who is this that aſcribes to chance or fortune the effects of the moſt <hi>unſearchable wiſdom</hi> and <hi>profound deſign;</hi> and therefore it follows, that <hi>Job</hi> in his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might not diſtruſt the <hi>providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and think that all things were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by an ungovernable neceſſity, and an inconſiderate fate, <hi>Gird up now thy Loyns like a Man, for</hi> I <hi>will demand of thee and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thou me. Where waſt thou when</hi> I <hi>laid the Foundations of the Earth? declare if thou hast underſtanding, who has laid the meaſures thereof, if thou knoweſt? or who hath ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the line upon it? Whereupon are the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations thereof faſtned, or who laid the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone thereof?</hi> And much more to the ſame purpoſe, in this and the following, and in ſeveral other Chapters, wherein the Providence of <hi>God,</hi> in the <hi>Creation</hi> of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102592:143"/> 
               <hi>World,</hi> and in the <hi>government</hi> of it, is with great ſtrength and eloquence vindicated and aſſerted, as indeed the whole Book of <hi>Job,</hi> is little elſe but a diſcourſe upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the beſt that ever was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon that Subject; ſo alſo the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks as it were, in imitation of <hi>Jobs Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſtical</hi> way, <hi>Who hath meaſured the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the hollow of his hand, and meeted out Heaven with the ſpan, and comprehended the duſt of the Earth in a meaſure, and weighed the Mountains in ſcales and the Hills in a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance?</hi> Then which expreſſions it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to frame any more ſignificant, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the power and wiſdom of <hi>God,</hi> and to let us ſee that this world was not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of chance, but of the moſt wiſe and wonderful deſign and knowledge; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> tells us, tho' I know that place be otherwiſe interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Socinian Doctors,</hi> who have a great deal to anſwer for, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of perverſe and diſtorted Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, where he impleads and impeaches the <hi>Heathen World,</hi> as guilty of inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Idolatry,</hi> becauſe, that <hi>vvhen they knevv God, they glorified him not as God, neither vvere thankful, but became vain in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and their fooliſh heart vvas dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:102592:143"/> and if you ask him how they <hi>knevv God?</hi> he anſwers, <hi>it vvas by the vvorks of the Creation,</hi> in which, as in a Glaſs, his Divinity and his attributes are clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, <hi>Rom. 1. v. 19, 20. That vvhich may be ſeen of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhevved it unto them, for the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of him, from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Povv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Godhead, ſo that they are vvithout ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither does the Scripture <hi>aſſert</hi> the Providence of God only as to the whole <hi>creation</hi> taken together, or as to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more <hi>conſiderable</hi> parts of it; but that it extends to every <hi>individual</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to the moſt <hi>minute,</hi> inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, diſregarded things that are to be met with in it. <hi>Are not two Sparrows,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſold for a Farthing, and one of them ſhall not fall to the ground, without your Father?</hi> But, as for us, he tells us, <hi>that the very Hairs of our Head are all numbred;</hi> and in another place, he adviſes his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in theſe words: <hi>Take ye no thought for to morrow what ye ſhall eat, nor what ye ſhall drink, nor yet for your Body what ye ſhall put on; behold the Fowls of the Air, for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102592:144"/> they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into Barns, yet your Heavenly</hi> Father <hi>feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them; are you not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought, can add one cubit unto his Stature? And why take ye thought for Rayment? conſider the Lillies of the Field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they ſpin, and yet</hi> I <hi>ſay unto you, that even</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his Glory, was not arrayed like one of theſe; wherefore if God ſo cloth</hi> the <hi>Graſs, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the Oven; ſhall he not much more cloth you, O ye of little Faith:</hi> This is likewiſe the language of the Book of Job; <hi>he provideth for the Raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God;</hi> and of the Pſalmiſt, in the 104th Pſalm: <hi>He ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Springs into the Valleys, which run among the Hills, they give drink to every Beaſt of the Field, the Wild Aſses quench their thirst, by them ſhall the Fowls of the Heaven have their Habitation, which ſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Branches; he watereth the Hills from his Channels, the earth is ſatisfied with the fruit of thy works; he cauſeth the graſs to grow for the Cattle, and Herb for the ſervice of man, that he may bring forth Food out of the Earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and Oyl to make his face to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102592:144"/> ſhine, and bread which ſtrengtheneth mans heart;</hi> and in another place, ſpeaking of the Organization and <hi>contexture</hi> of his own Body, and of all the Parts and Members and Veſſels of which it conſiſts, which may be underſtood in proportion of the Bodies of all other Animals likewiſe, he ſays, <hi>thou haſt covered me in my Mothers Womb,</hi> I <hi>will praiſe thee, for</hi> I <hi>am fearfully and wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made; marvellous are thy Works, and that my Soul knoweth right well, my Subſtance was not hid from thee, when</hi> I <hi>was made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the lowest parts of the earth, thine eyes did ſee my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance yet being imperfect, and in thy Book were all my Members written, which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of them: How precious are thy Thoughts unto me, O God? how great is the ſumme of them?</hi> So that this is plainly and conſtantly the language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well as it is of nature and of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <hi>that all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that</hi> was <hi>made,</hi> that God alone <hi>is worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Glory and Honour and Power, for that he hath created all things, and for his pleaſure they are and were created;</hi> that he who is the Eternal Source of Wiſdom, Power
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102592:145"/> and Goodneſs, hath <hi>created all things for himſelf,</hi> that is, to be teſtimonies to the world of his Attributes, and his perfections, of his unſpeakable Mercy, his unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knowledge, and his unlimited power, and that all things were made chiefly for theſe two ends: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to be a ſtanding <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of his <hi>exiſtence</hi> and his <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> to contribute to the happineſs of his Creatures, and to the mutual ſubſiſtence of each other.</p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Epicureans</hi> they tell us, that all things came by chance, that the <hi>Ear</hi> was not made for <hi>hearing,</hi> nor the <hi>Eye</hi> for <hi>ſeeing,</hi> nor the <hi>Noſtrils</hi> for <hi>ſmelling,</hi> but that all this ſeeming <hi>contrivance</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing <hi>VViſdom</hi> is owing to nothing elſe, but to the lucky <hi>concourſe</hi> of <hi>Atomes</hi> happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed after ſuch a manner as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for that purpoſe; and therefore by conſequence that it was but an idle <hi>taunt</hi> which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> beſtows upon the <hi>Idols</hi> of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> Pſal. 115.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their Idols are Silver and Gold, the work of mens hands, they have mouths but they ſpeak not, eyes have they but they ſee not; they have ears but they hear not; noſes have they, but they ſmell not; they have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither ſpeak
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102592:145"/> they through their Throat:</hi> For at this rate it could be no manner of <hi>diſparagement</hi> to thoſe <hi>Idols,</hi> if having ſuch parts as <hi>ears</hi> and <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> and <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>noſe,</hi> they had not that uſe of them, which was meerly accidental; and for which they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſigned and intended.</p>
            <p>And as this alone is ſufficient to prove the <hi>Epicureans</hi> of old to have been down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> that they denyed the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and left the <hi>VVorld</hi> to the <hi>management</hi> of <hi>chance</hi> and <hi>fortune;</hi> for we have no <hi>natural reaſon</hi> to perſwade us that there is a God, but what is taken from the <hi>contrivance, order, beauty</hi> and <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of the whole <hi>Creation,</hi> and of the ſeveral <hi>Parts</hi> whereof it is compoſed; ſo the ſame heavy <hi>Impeachment</hi> lyes ſtill more preſſing and unanſwerable againſt <hi>Des Cartez,</hi> who being born and bred up in a Country profeſſing Chriſtianity, and a <hi>Belief</hi> not only of the <hi>exiſtence,</hi> but the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> did yet aſcribe all things (that he might magnifie himſelf, as being able to contrive a World, as well as he that really did it) to the <hi>Mechanical Powers</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> which as it hath no <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>activity</hi> of it's own, ſo it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it's <hi>motions</hi> ſhould be <hi>regular,</hi> unleſs we

            </p>

            <p>The next thing which I ſhall Inſtance in, as a plain indication, how inclinable this Author was to baniſh the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>God</hi> out of the <hi>World,</hi> is his declining ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly and ſo profeſſedly as he does, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, to ſay any thing of <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> though indeed his whole <hi>Philoſophy</hi> be nothing elſe but one continued <hi>harangue,</hi> concerning <hi>infinite Extention</hi> or <hi>matter,</hi> and what is this but loudly proclaiming to all the World, that for <hi>immaterial Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> eſpecially that which is pretended to be infinite, they are ſtrange unintelligible things, and that the beſt way is not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our heads about them?</p>
            <p>In the next place, his boggling at the ſeeming inconſiſtency betwixt the <hi>Divine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102592:147"/> praeſcience</hi> and <hi>Human freedom,</hi> under the ſame pretence of not medling with <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> and yet granting the latter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing plainly, that it is this inconſiſtent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Human faculties</hi> with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, what is but to ſay, if he were to ſpeak openly the ſence of his mind, that there is no ſuch thing as any ſuch <hi>praeſcience</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, if he would ſpeak out, that there is no God at all.</p>
            <p>For though <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers will not allow God to have any <hi>foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>contingent actions,</hi> that is to ſay, of thoſe <hi>actions</hi> which depend upon <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man freedom,</hi> becauſe being contingent, and conſequently uncertain, they tell us, there is no foundation for a certain and determinate <hi>knowledge,</hi> yet at the ſame time they grant, that he does certainly <hi>foreknow,</hi> whatever hath any certain and determinate <hi>cauſes,</hi> and is by that means an <hi>object</hi> of <hi>cognoſcibility,</hi> by which, tho' they may be thought to <hi>derogate</hi> from the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his <hi>Nature,</hi> yet his <hi>being</hi> in <hi>general</hi> they do <hi>expreſly</hi> acknowledge; but <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez</hi> will not concern himſelf, whether ſuch <hi>actions</hi> can be <hi>foreknown</hi> or no, or whether
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102592:148"/> the <hi>Divine foreknowledge</hi> being ſuppoſed in that <hi>extent</hi> and <hi>latitude,</hi> with which it is uſually maintained, would be any obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the liberty of <hi>inferiour Agents,</hi> but he ſlubbers over the buſineſs after his uſual rate, ſaying, <hi>that the notion of a God includes in it infinite perfection</hi> and therefore if it be poſſible for him to <hi>foreknow contingent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> he does <hi>foreknow</hi> them, that is, if it be poſſible there ſhould be a <hi>God,</hi> there is <hi>one,</hi> and he deſires to be excuſed from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming or denying any thing any further, concerning <hi>God Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is it ſufficient to ſay in this caſe, that the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>VVill,</hi> which <hi>Des Cartes</hi> manifeſtly grants, does undeniably prove an <hi>immaterial ſubſtance,</hi> to which I do very frankly and heartily <hi>aſsent,</hi> but yet we know the <hi>Old Epicureans</hi> did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it as well as <hi>Des Cartez,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they referred it to a <hi>material cauſe,</hi> which however abſurd and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was, of producing ſuch an <hi>effect,</hi> yet why may not <hi>one Philoſopher</hi> be abſurd as well as <hi>another?</hi> As all that dote upon <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm</hi> and <hi>matter,</hi> muſt run into <hi>infinite abſurdities,</hi> whether they will or no; and though we ſhould ſuppoſe <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> not to have acquieſced in the ſolution of his

               <hi>old Maſters,</hi> who yet were <hi>Men,</hi> as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for their <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>wit,</hi> as any in their <hi>times,</hi> nor indeed to have pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any particular way, whereby to explain ſo difficult an effect, yet we have no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſecurity from him, that it was not his opinion, that it might be owing to ſome <hi>particular diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>matter,</hi> though what that <hi>diſpoſition</hi> was he would not take upon him to <hi>determine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though he diſtinguiſhes indeed very nicely betwixt <hi>cogitation</hi> and <hi>extention,</hi> yet it being true, that the ſeveral <hi>diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> or <hi>modifications</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> are <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the <hi>matter</hi> it <hi>ſelf,</hi> in the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which is capable of being altered and diverſifyed infinite ways, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned to another great <hi>truth,</hi> that no <hi>ſubstance</hi> can be <hi>conceived</hi> but what is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi> I ſay, all this being true, what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can we have after all his <hi>Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> parting of things and things from <hi>one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> but he did <hi>really</hi> believe that <hi>cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and all the ſeveral ſorts and ſpecies of it, were but ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>modes</hi> and <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> of the <hi>univerſal matter?</hi>

               <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> A further Proof of IMMATERIAL EXTENSION.</head>
            <p>THus have I endeavoured, which was the firſt thing propoſed to be done, to make a further <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of the <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Arts,</hi> to introduce <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi> into the World, and they all depend upon this one <hi>Principle,</hi> that there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor can be, any thing <hi>extended,</hi> but <hi>matter,</hi> which though I have already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſproved in a foregoing <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> yet that I may further evince the unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable certainty of ſo <hi>important</hi> a <hi>Doctrine</hi> I will now proceed, as I have promiſed in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place to ſtrengthen and confirm it by ſome other <hi>conſiderations,</hi> which I will but juſt name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> therefore if <hi>Des Cartez</hi> be, as he pretends he is, really in earneſt, when he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102592:150"/> tells us there is a God, and that the <hi>matter</hi> of which this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> conſiſts, was in the beginning of things created by him, then certainly it will be granted, that he that created all things might, if he pleaſed, have created only one ſolid <hi>Globe</hi> or <hi>Sphere,</hi> and he that might create one, might alſo if he ſo pleaſed, have created <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> and let theſe <hi>three</hi> come as nigh as they can poſſibly together, yet they cannot touch one another in above one point; ſo that there will unavoidably be a <hi>Triangular ſpace</hi> between them, which muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be <hi>diſtinct</hi> from <hi>matter,</hi> becauſe it is ſuppoſed that there is no more matter in the <hi>world,</hi> then that of which theſe <hi>three Globes</hi> are compoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that a <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> out of nothing, but out of the <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>fruitfulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Divine being</hi> is a poſſible thing; I prove from theſe three <hi>conſiderations; Firſt,</hi> from the <hi>ſluggiſh, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>unactive nature</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> it ſelf, which it does not ſeem as if it were derived from it ſelf, or were capable of preſerving it ſelf in being, for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> from this, that the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is pretended, why matter is <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:102592:151"/> or why it could never be <hi>Created</hi> is this, that no <hi>real nature</hi> or thing can be produced out of nothing, which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a <hi>two fold Anſwer, Firſt,</hi> that the <hi>Divine goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are not to be looked upon as nothing, they being the greateſt and the firſt <hi>realities</hi> of all, upon which all other things have a neceſſary dependance, and it is out of the <hi>Eternal fruitfulneſs</hi> of theſe that the matter is <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</hi> And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that <hi>motion</hi> is every whit as real a <hi>thing</hi> and as ſenſible as <hi>matter,</hi> and produces every day abundance of very ſtrange and ſurprizing <hi>effects</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> and yet I have proved clearly in a <hi>former diſcourſe,</hi> beyond all <hi>poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of doubt or ſcruple, that this may be, and is actually <hi>Created</hi> and <hi>annihilated</hi> as occaſion ſerves, and as it ſeems good to the <hi>Divine wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then <hi>thirdly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> we muſt either ſay with the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that all this <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>wonderful contrivance,</hi> as it appears to be, was yet notwithſtanding nothing better than the effect of chance, that it is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by an eternal good luck, as well as it was made at firſt without any deſign, which is a moſt incredible and fooliſh thing to ſuppoſe, or elſe we muſt acknowledge that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102592:151"/> there is one great and univerſal mind, by which the frame and order af all things was contrived, which ſince it cannot be conceived to be done any otherwiſe then by a bare act of his Will, it is every whit as eaſy to conceive, how by the ſame means he ſhould command the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Being, when as yet it was not, as how by a meer thought, and an inward Decree and Ordinance within himſelf, he ſhould diſpoſe and regulate it after ſo wonderful a manner, or how by a continued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated act of the ſame goodneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he ſhould continue that <hi>order</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabliſhment</hi> which he had made, for ſo many ſeveral ſucceeding <hi>Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>thirdly,</hi> in the <hi>motion</hi> of <hi>Bodies</hi> too and fro, it is neceſſary that there ſhould be a <hi>ſpace,</hi> into which the bodies that are moved ſhould be received, otherwiſe there could be no <hi>motion</hi> at all, and yet ſeveral <hi>bodies</hi> ſucceeding <hi>one another,</hi> and taking up exactly the ſame room, as in the <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> or in the <hi>courſe</hi> of a <hi>River;</hi> or the like, it is a plain caſe there muſt be a common <hi>extenſion</hi> or <hi>ſpace,</hi> which is not <hi>matter,</hi> otherwiſe none of theſe bodies could be received into it.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:102592:152"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Des Cartes</hi> being asked this <hi>question,</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>God</hi> had <hi>created</hi> nothing in the beginning of <hi>things</hi> but only one <hi>hollow Veſſel,</hi> what would you ſay then? would there not in this caſe have been an <hi>extenſion,</hi> which was not <hi>matter,</hi> to this <hi>question</hi> he returned for <hi>anſwer,</hi> that in this caſe the ſides of the <hi>Veſſel</hi> would have come together, becauſe there was nothing between them, but this anſwer was abſurd and fooliſh upon ſeveral accounts; firſt, becauſe the <hi>ſpace</hi> we have been ſpeaking of has been proved to be a <hi>real thing,</hi> and that there is and muſt be ſuppoſed to be ſuch a thing in the World. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that this contradicts the great Principle of the <hi>Carteſian Philoſophy,</hi> which is that every thing will remain in the <hi>ſtate</hi> wherein it is, except it be <hi>diſturbed</hi> by ſome external cauſe, and there being in this caſe no <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe,</hi> that appears that ſhould puſh the ſides of the <hi>Veſſel</hi> together, there is no reaſon, why according to his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples it ſhould not remain in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which it vvas created.</p>
            <p>But then in the third place, ſuppoſe the ſides of ſuch a <hi>Veſſel</hi> ſhould come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet they could not come together, except they had been aſunder before;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102592:152"/> and that is ſufficient to prove as much as is <hi>requiſite</hi> for my purpoſe, that there is, or may be a <hi>ſpace,</hi> vvhich is not <hi>matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly</hi> and Laſtly, <hi>DesCartes</hi> being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſt in an <hi>Epistle</hi> from a learned man which hath been publiſhed together with <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his anſwer ſince the death of that <hi>Philoſoper,</hi> and ſeeing himſelf driven to this <hi>hard dilemma,</hi> that either he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>exiſténce</hi> of <hi>Immaterial Substances,</hi> or elſe he muſt grant their <hi>extenſion:</hi> one of which he dare not, and the other he was very loath to do, as a middle <hi>expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> between theſe two <hi>extreams:</hi> he made anſwer, <hi>Spiritus extenduntur ſuo modo, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or Immaterial Beings are extended after a manner peculiar to themſelves;</hi> which is all we contend for. For the extenſion of <hi>matter</hi> is dead and <hi>paſſive,</hi> that of Spirits <hi>active</hi> and ſelf-moving, the <hi>extenſion</hi> of one is an inſenſible <hi>extenſion,</hi> and is only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by thought and ſpeculation, but that of the other may very frequently be ſeen and felt, and is at leaſt a <hi>poſſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of our corporeal ſenſes, and this I think is difference enough.</p>

            <p>AND ſo I come to the third thing propoſed, which is concerning the <hi>advantages</hi> which this way of <hi>proving</hi> the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of a God, from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Divine extenſion</hi> hath above all other ways of inferring it that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been uſed. And thoſe <hi>advantages,</hi> are theſe three which follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it affords a ſenſible <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that there is ſuch a Being as a God; for I have proved by ſenſe, from every days <hi>experience,</hi> from the very Being of motion in the World, without which there vvould be no ſenſe or feeling of any thing vvhatſoever vvithout us; that there is <hi>infallibly</hi> a ſpac ediſtinct from <hi>matter,</hi> and that this <hi>ſpace</hi> is indued vvith all poſſible
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102592:153"/> Wiſdom, <hi>Goodneſs and Power,</hi> vvhich is all that is meant by God; and the ſame may be proved <hi>likewiſe</hi> from the conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the more hard and ſolid Bodies, for ſince the parts of them are not kept together meerly by the fullneſs of the World, or becauſe all things are ſo cram'd and ſtuft that nothing can yield, ſince there is a <hi>ſpace,</hi> into which the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and diſunited parts may fly, that there is any ſuch thing as an hard or ſolid Body in the world, can be attributed to nothing but a <hi>Divine Power</hi> by which the parts of the <hi>matter</hi> are kept together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> as this way of <hi>proceeding</hi> gives the moſt certain account of the <hi>Divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,</hi> ſo it ſerves the beſt to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his <hi>Providence;</hi> for it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that an <hi>unextended ſubſtance</hi> ſhould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage all things at ſo ſtrange a rate, as if he were every where <hi>actually preſent,</hi> and this is the <hi>anſwer</hi> which <hi>Socrates</hi> gave to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtodemus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> when he objected the impoſſibility of one <hi>Being,</hi> being able to manage all things by himſelf, <hi>God,</hi> ſaid <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, is ſo large a Being, that he can eaſily manage all things at once, without any trouble or diſturbance to himſelf.</hi>

A very fair Interpretation of that paſſage in the Prophet <hi>Eſai.</hi>—I know this is interpreted by the Evangeliſt St. <hi>Mark,</hi> 15. 28. of our <hi>Saviours</hi> being Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed between two Thieves. <hi>And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was fulfilled, which ſaith, and he was numbred with the Tranſgreſſors.</hi> But this is not inconſiſtent with that Interpretation which I have put upon it, and it is no new thing, that the ſame <hi>Prophecy</hi> may have more <hi>Senſes</hi> then <hi>one,</hi> as in that of <hi>Mat. 8. v. 16, 17. He caſt out the Spirits with his word, and healed all that were ſick, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by</hi> Eſaias <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſaying, himſelf took our infirmities and bare our ſickneſses,</hi> though there is no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102592:155"/> but this place was likewiſe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his ſuffering for us, and taking our ſins upon him upon the Croſs, and ſo it is expreſly applied by St. <hi>Peter. 1 Pet. 2. 24.

I grant that theſe two, as is certain from divers places in <hi>Scripture,</hi> were real places in the land of <hi>Palestine,</hi> but yet the <hi>Sun</hi> could not ſtand ſtill in the midſt of <hi>Heaven</hi> in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> but it muſt do equally ſo to all places in the ſame <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> at the ſame time, and to all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whatſoever, that were in any other <hi>Meridian,</hi> at the ſame certain diſtance from it, wherefore I take them rather in this place, to be <hi>technical Terms, Gibeon</hi> is the <hi>Zenith</hi> of any place, (and of <hi>Gibeon</hi> it ſelf in this inſtance,) from <hi>Gabah altum, elatum eſse,</hi> for it is ſaid expreſly, that the <hi>Sun ſtood ſtill in the midſt of Heaven,</hi> that is, in the <hi>Zenith</hi> or <hi>Vertical Point,</hi> and the <hi>Valley</hi> of <hi>Ajalon,</hi> being as <hi>proverbially</hi> famous for a low and hollow <hi>Valley,</hi> as the other was for a mountanous and hilly place, ſignified

                  <hi>Diſcourſe of the Meſſias. p.</hi> 20. and by the writings of <hi>Daniel,</hi> they were inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the time of his appearance, <hi>ſee Dan. 9. v.</hi> 25, 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 41. That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was expected by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, at the very time when our <hi>Saviour</hi> appeared:) <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> did openly declare himſelf to be the immediate <hi>forerunner</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was to come, and he did implicitly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge at his <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the very Perſon, who, according to his own Character, <hi>coming after him was to be preferred before him, John</hi> 1. 27. for ſo he did actually prefer him before himſelf, <hi>Mat. 3. 14. I have need to be baptiſed of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</hi> nay, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſtill more expreſly, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was actually come, <hi>John 1. 6. I Baptize with water, but there ſtandeth one among you whom ye know not,</hi> that is, the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as he expreſſes himſelf more fully, <hi>Mat. 3. 11. I indeed baptiſe you with water unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but he that cometh after me is mightier then I, whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102592:161"/> he ſhall baptiſe you with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire,</hi> again <hi>John 1. 36. John looking upon Jeſus as he walked, he ſaith, behold the Lamb of God.</hi> By which it is plain that he did at once acknowledge him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be a Sacrifice for the Sins of the World, that is, a <hi>ſuffering,</hi> not a <hi>triumphant Perſon,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time generally expected, not excepting ſome of the Diſciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which was the reaſon of that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious requeſt of the Mother of the Sons of <hi>Zebedec,</hi> in behalf of her Children, that the <hi>one might ſit on his right hand, and the other on his left in his Kingdom,</hi> and that the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> who heard him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> is plain, by <hi>v.</hi> 37. 40, 41. compard together, <hi>v. 37. and the two Diſciples</hi> (that were with <hi>John v. 35.) heard him ſpeak, and they followed Jeſus,</hi> and then <hi>v. 40, 41. One of the two which heard</hi> John <hi>ſpeak, was</hi> Andrew, Simon Peter's <hi>Brother, he firſt findeth his own brother</hi> Simon, <hi>and ſaith unto him, we have found the</hi> Meſſias, <hi>which is being interpreted, the</hi> Chriſt. So <hi>Philip</hi> alſo acknowledgeth him to be the Chriſt. <hi>v. 45. We have found him, of whom</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Law, and the</hi> Prophets <hi>did write,</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel. v. 49. Rabbi, thou
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102592:161"/> art the Son of God, thou art the King of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> but yet <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> afterwards being in Priſon, and hearing our <hi>Saviours</hi> miracles, ſeems to have doubted with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether he were really the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was expected, though he ſtill might look upon himſelf to be the forerunner of that <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and might expect his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as about that time, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was not at that time fully aſſured, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> was indeed the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Mat. 11. 2, 3. Now when John heard in Priſon the works of Chriſt, he ſent two of his Diſciples and ſaid unto him, art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for another?</hi> In anſwer to which our Saviour proves his unction, and undoubted defignation to the <hi>Meſſiasſhip,</hi> by his miracles, and by the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall charity</hi> and <hi>good will,</hi> that appeared as well in his miracles as his Doctrine. <hi>v. 4. 5. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, go and ſhew</hi> John <hi>thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee, the Blind receive their ſight and the Lame walk; the Leapers are cleanſed, and the Deaf hear, the Dead are raiſed up, and the Poor have the Goſpel preached to them,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>v. 6. and bleſſed is he, whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me,</hi> that is whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, upon the Teſtimony of thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102592:162"/> which I daily work, and out of a true reliſh and ſavour of that excellent <hi>Doctrine</hi> which I daily preach, ſhall acknowledge me without <hi>ſcruple</hi> or <hi>heſitancy</hi> for the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> and ſhall believe in me and follow me as ſuch.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that he was generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as well by <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Samaritans,</hi> about the time when he appeared, is evident of the <hi>Jews,</hi> firſt by the meſſage which they ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt. Jo. 1. 19, 20, 21. This is the Record of</hi> John, <hi>when the</hi> Jews <hi>ſent Prieſts and Levites from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to ask him who art thou? And he confeſſed and denied not, but confeſſed, I am not the Chriſt; And they asked him, what then art thou</hi> Elias? <hi>And he ſaith I am not; Art thou that Prophet; And he anſwered no,</hi> Now theſe would have been very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent queſtions, upon ſuppoſition that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or his forerunner <hi>Elias,</hi> or ſome other great <hi>Prophet</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> &amp; as it were the Mantle of <hi>Elias,</hi> baring Teſtimony of him, and preparing the way for his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate reception, were not expected at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> this appears again concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> by that queſtion of our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>Matt. 16. v. 13. Whom do
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102592:162"/> Men ſay that I the Son of Man am?</hi> To which they anſwer <hi>v. 14. Some ſay thou art</hi> John <hi>the</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>ſome</hi> Elias, <hi>and others</hi> Jeremias <hi>or one of the</hi> Prophets; which is as much as to ſay, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of opinion, that it was neceſſary, juſt before the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> or ſome other of the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſhould riſe from the dead, to bear Teſtimony to him, and that that time was now come, our Saviour by his miracles appearing to be ſuch a Perſon, as they thought; for the <hi>Scribes,</hi> that is, the more learned and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſort among the <hi>Jews,</hi> expected two things concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (beſides that, he was not to be an afflicted but a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and a glorious Perſon, the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſuch a King, whoſe <hi>Kingdom</hi> was to be <hi>of this World) Firſt,</hi> that he was to be of the Linage and Seed of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; as appears by our Saviours queſtion, <hi>Mark. 12. 35. How ſay the Scribes, that Chriſt is the Son of</hi> David? And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming, <hi>Elias</hi> or ſome other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> was to riſe from the dead to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, as appears by another queſtion of the Diſciples to him, Mat. 17. 10. <hi>Why then ſay the Scribes, that Elias muſt firſt come?</hi> That is, <hi>Elias</hi> or ſome other of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102592:163"/> in the Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> and of equal dignity with him, as appears by what hath been ſaid already, and as appears by our Saviours anſwer, <hi>ver. 12. Elias is come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and they knew him not;</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> as the Diſciples themſelves underſtood it, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt did alſo declare of himſelf, that he was the forerunner of Chriſt in the Spirit of <hi>Elias;</hi> but he was not believed, becauſe he had not yet riſen from the dead, as he was conjectur'd afterwards by <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch</hi> to have done, Mat. 14. 12. <hi>At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the Fame of Jeſus, and ſaid unto his Servants, this is</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt, he is riſen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do ſhew forth themſelves in him. And therefore?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? what meerly becauſe he was riſen from the dead? no, but becauſe he was ſuppoſed to ariſe from the dead, for this end, to confirm by Miracles what he had ſaid before; that he was the <hi>Forerunuer</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was to come. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this the <hi>Jews</hi> would not believe him to be the <hi>Elias</hi> or the Preparatory <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> that was expected; and upon this <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that one riſen from the dead was to prepare the way for the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:102592:163"/> that was to come, that circumſtance in the parable of the <hi>Rich man</hi> was founded in the 16th of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> where he beggs of <hi>Abraham, that he would ſend Lazarus to his Fathers houſe, to give his Brethren warning, that they might not come into the ſame place of Torment,</hi> verſe 29. <hi>Abraham ſaith unto him, they have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them;</hi> to which he anſwers in the next words—ver. 30. <hi>nay, Father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent.</hi> And perhaps it was to humour this fancy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples themſelves as <hi>Jews,</hi> may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to have <hi>entertained,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> met as it were at a conference or aſſignation with our Saviour in an high Mountain in the preſence of <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> three of the moſt belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and highly favoured Diſciples, Mat. 17. 3.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had the ſame opinion with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was expected at the time when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our appeared upon the Earth, may be ſeen from the words of the <hi>Samaritan-woman,</hi> ſpeaking of his coming as a thing then in a manner preſent, a thing juſt at the door, and beginning actually to be accompliſht, John 4. 25. <hi>I know that Meſſias cometh,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102592:164"/> which is called Chriſt; when he is come, he will tell us all things.</hi> And our Saviour aſſures her in the next verſe, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the very perſon, but ſhe not ſo much relying upon that, as upon his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical inſight into the moſt particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of her life, ſaid unto the men of the City where ſhe dwelt, verſe 29. <hi>Come ſee a man which told me all things that ever</hi> I <hi>did; is not this the Chriſt?</hi> the Chriſt that was then expected, the Meſſias that was then looked upon as being juſt at the door.</p>
               <p>And this was the reaſon why our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſo <hi>frequently</hi> forewarned his Diſciples to beware of <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Falſe Chriſts;</hi> becauſe that being the time when the <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was expected, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pretence to the Meſſiasſhip was the more dangerous, and the more apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. If you ask why they did not receive him as the Chriſt, notwithſtanding his Miracles, and the time ſo exactly ſuiting with the received opinion of the <hi>Jews?</hi> the anſwer is fourfold. Firſt, they thought him to have been born in <hi>Nazareth of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> from whence <hi>no good</hi> could ariſe, as it was then proverbially ſaid, not in <hi>Bethlem</hi> of <hi>Judah;</hi> ſecondly they looked upon him as the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102592:164"/> whom they did not look upon to be of the Lineage of <hi>David;</hi> not of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> only, by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt. Thirdly, his oppoſing himſelf ſo much as he did to the Hypocriſie and Formality of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, engaged a ſtrong and powerful Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him, who were reſolved whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came of it, to decry him all they could, and blaſt his reputation to the utmoſt of their power. Fourthly, they expected not a Suffering, but <hi>a</hi> Triumphant <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who ſhould reſtore the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and trample upon the necks of all their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies throughout the world, which was the reaſon of <hi>Herods</hi> killing of all the children, from two years old and under, as hoping to find the <hi>Chriſt</hi> among them, whom he looked upon as a <hi>Temporal Prince,</hi> thinking by this means to ſecure the Kingdom to himſelf.</p>
